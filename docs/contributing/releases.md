# Releases

How a change in this repository becomes a tagged release: the `VERSION` file, the CHANGELOG contract,
what CI does on merge to `main`, and the two fail-closed gates a harness self-build must clear before its
PR opens. For contributors preparing a PR.

## VERSION

`VERSION` is a single line holding a semver triple. Two things validate it:

- Integrity check 9a requires `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$`. See [validation](validation.md).
- The release workflow re-reads it and hard-fails on a missing file or a non-semver value.

There is no manual release script, and an implementation PR never edits `VERSION` — it declares
`Release-Semver` (`major`, `minor`, or `patch`) in its release metadata instead. The bot-owned release
PR aggregates the highest declared impact across its candidates and computes the next `VERSION` itself.

### Version freeze

This repository sets `harness_self_host.version_freeze` in `.ai-conductor/config.yml` to `latest`, which
tracks the resolved base branch's `VERSION` rather than pinning a literal — so a bot-owned release does
not leave every self-host build halting on a stale freeze until an operator bumps the key by hand. While
the worktree `VERSION` equals the resolved frozen value, the self-host VERSION approval gate
self-satisfies. A feature that actually changes `VERSION` still HALTs for operator approval. This is a self-host arrangement specific to
this repo, not default harness behavior — see [self-hosting](../guides/self-hosting.md).

## Semver rules

| Bump | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| MAJOR | A breaking change to skill contracts, the `bin/conduct` CLI, or the `settings.json` schema. |
| MINOR | A new skill, a new hook, a new gate, an additive HARNESS.md rule. |
| PATCH | A bug fix, wording, non-behavioral cleanup. |

## The CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` contract

`CHANGELOG.md` must contain a literal `## [Unreleased]` header. Integrity check 9b enforces its presence;
check 9c enforces that every `vX.Y.Z` tag has a matching `## [X.Y.Z]` section.

### When an entry is required

A changelog entry is required **only** when the PR contains a notable reader-visible implementation
change. These add nothing:

- non-notable implementation changes,
- specification-only changes,
- documentation-only changes,
- changes with no implementation at all.

An empty `[Unreleased]` is a successful no-release path: no changelog rewrite, no VERSION bump, no tag,
no release commit, no GitHub Release.

This eligibility policy is specific to this repository's custom-step configuration. Consumer projects
without it follow the global harness release convention unchanged.

### How an empty release set is decided

The release-PR maintainer creates a candidate only from complete, eligible merged-PR metadata. If it
has no candidate, no release PR exists to merge and publication is a no-op. The publisher also ignores
ordinary `main` pushes: it publishes only a merged `automation/release-pr` owned by the configured GitHub
App and carrying successful, head-bound release-candidate audit evidence.

### Re-run release-PR maintenance

To reconcile the release PR after a failed or interrupted maintenance run, open the
`release-pr-maintenance` workflow in GitHub Actions and select **Run workflow** on the repository's
default branch. The workflow serializes this run with merge-triggered maintenance and renders from that
branch's current commit. A manual run on any other ref fails before checkout and makes no release-branch
changes.

The release gate does **not** require `[Unreleased]` to be non-empty. Integrity owns the changelog's
structure; the gate reads release metadata only for migration-block validation.

### How candidates are found

The maintainer collects every commit in `<latest tag>..HEAD` on `main` and attributes each one to a
merged PR. Merge commits are disabled on this repository, so a PR lands on `main` as a single-parent
squash or rebase commit — the candidate range is deliberately **not** restricted to merge commits.

Attribution is by `merge_commit_sha`, which GitHub sets to the squashed commit for a squash merge and
to the replayed head for a rebase merge. A rebase merge also replays the PR's earlier commits onto
`main`; those are attributed through GitHub's commit-to-PR association and contribute no second
candidate for the same PR. Anything left over — a direct push to `main`, or a commit whose PR is
outside the range — is an unexplained commit, and the collection is incomplete: the maintainer fails
the run rather than proposing a release that under-reports what shipped.

## What CI does on merge to main

`.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on every `push` to `main` and runs three jobs in order:

1. `classify` reads the release-PR provenance, audit, and committed artifacts, then exposes whether the
   commit is publishable. It performs no publication mutation.
2. `smoke` runs only for a publishable classification. It calls the reusable live-daemon E2E workflow with
   inherited secrets and `require_credentials: true`. That workflow runs one complete fail-closed smoke-tier
   gate (`SMOKE_MODE=gate npm run smoke`) and independent selected-file Claude and Codex legs for provider
   reporting — see [testing](testing.md#smoke-tests).
3. `publish` runs only when the classification remains publishable and the smoke job concludes `success`.
   Cancelled, timed-out, skipped, and failed smoke jobs do not authorize publication.

Ordinary `main` merges stop after classification, so they do not spend live-provider tokens. A blocked
smoke run creates no tag or GitHub Release; after the issue is resolved, re-run the same workflow. The
publisher still re-derives all release authority immediately before mutation:

1. The main commit must be the merge commit of the configured App-owned `automation/release-pr` into `main`.
2. That PR must have successful release-candidate audit evidence bound to its exact head.
3. The merged files must contain a matching `VERSION` and non-empty versioned `CHANGELOG.md` section.
4. Existing tag and GitHub Release state must match the approved artifact; retries create only a missing tag
   or release.
5. After both publication artifacts exist, `refs/heads/stable` is created or fast-forwarded to the same
   release commit. The update is non-forced and a failure fails the publish job; retrying the workflow
   verifies the existing artifacts and safely retries only the stable-branch advance.
   The hosted documentation site (GitHub Pages) publishes from `stable:/docs`, so a release cut is
   also the moment new documentation goes live; a docs change merged to `main` stays unpublished until
   the next cut.

The publisher creates the annotated tag and GitHub Release through GitHub APIs. It never rewrites
`CHANGELOG.md`, bumps `VERSION`, creates a release commit, or pushes `main`. `stable` therefore never points
at an ordinary implementation merge or a release that has not completed publication. An ordinary merge or
an empty candidate set is ignored and produces no release.

## The self-host release gate

`src/conductor/src/engine/self-host/release-gate.ts` composes two fail-closed sub-gates that a harness
self-build must clear at finish, **before a PR opens**. `runReleaseArtifactGate` HALTs on the first
failure with that gate's distinct reason and does not consult later gates; the caller must not open a PR
when the verdict is not ok. Each failure writes `.pipeline/HALT`.

### Where the gate reads release metadata from

The metadata input is the **retained SHIP draft PR** — the draft the conductor opens at SHIP-phase
entry and `release-disposition` writes into. The engine remembers that PR's URL in memory, but the
publisher that sets it is advisory and runs at most once per run, so a transient `git push` failure on
a run whose PR is already open used to leave the identity unset and HALT the feature with *"retained
draft PR identity is unavailable"* while its draft sat open on origin.

The identity is therefore resolved from durable state instead: when no URL was retained, the engine
asks GitHub (through the injected `gh` seam) for the PR whose head is the feature branch and whose base
is the build's base branch. The lookup stays fail-closed and deliberately narrow:

| Situation | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| An **OPEN** PR for this head and base | Resolved and reused, draft or already ready-for-review |
| Only **CLOSED** or **MERGED** PRs for the branch | No match — the gate still HALTs |
| A PR on another head or into another base | No match — the gate still HALTs |
| No base branch resolved, or `gh` fails | No match — the gate still HALTs |

A closed or merged PR is never adopted: `finish` flips and rewrites the PR it is handed, and neither is
a live draft. The HALT reason names the branch and base that found nothing.

### Sub-gate 1: the integrity suite

Runs `test/test_harness_integrity.sh` with a 120-second default budget. All three failure modes HALT and
none can be mistaken for a pass:

| Condition | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Script not found | "refusing to open a PR without running it" |
| Timed out | "treated as failure, not an indefinite block" |
| Non-zero exit | HALT naming the exit code |

### Sub-gate 2: the migration block

A change touching a canonical breaking surface requires a runnable migration block in the
implementation PR's release metadata — the `## Migration` section of the PR body, parsed into
`ReleaseDisposition.migration` — not `CHANGELOG.md`. Uncertainty fails closed.

#### Canonical breaking surfaces

Reproduced verbatim from `release-gate.ts:108-113`:

```ts
export const CANONICAL_BREAKING_SURFACES = [
  'bin/conduct CLI',
  'skill symlink targets',
  'hook wiring',
  'settings.json schema',
] as const;
```

`classifyBreakingSurfaces` inspects the destination path of every changed file and, for `R` (rename) or
`C` (copy) statuses, the original path as well — so a move into *or* out of a surface is caught on either
side.

| Path predicate | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `p === 'bin/conduct'` | `bin/conduct CLI` |
| `p === 'bin/install'` | `skill symlink targets` |
| `p.startsWith('hooks/')` or `p.includes('/hooks/')` | `hook wiring` |
| `/(^\|\/)settings(\.local)?\.json$/.test(p)` | `settings.json schema` |
| `p.startsWith('skills/')` **and** status starts with `D` or `R` | `skill symlink targets` |

Adding a skill is additive and non-breaking. Deleting or renaming one changes symlink targets and is
breaking.

A `null` change set — one the gate could not determine — returns
`{ breaking: false, uncertain: true, surfaces: [] }` and is treated as requiring a migration block.

#### What counts as a migration block

```ts
// release-gate.ts
const MIGRATION_SECTION_RE = /(?:^|\n)###?\s+Migration\s*\n([\s\S]*?)(?=\n##\s|$)/;

// release-metadata.ts
const runnableMigrationFenceRe = /^```bash migration\s*\n[\s\S]*?```$/;
```

A ```` ```bash migration ```` fence inside a `## Migration` (or `### Migration`) section. These mirror
`bin/migrate`'s own regexes, so "runnable" means exactly what `bin/migrate` will execute when a consumer
updates past this version.

The fence is the migration; the rest of the section is prose. A sentence telling the operator what the
block does may sit above it, below it, or between two fences, and `bin/migrate`, the release gate, and
`ReleaseDisposition.migration` all read only the fences. A section carrying no fence must say exactly
`none`.

The `## Migration` section and the `Release-*` block may appear in either order, with or without a
`---` between them, and either may be the last thing in the body — the `Closes owner/repo#N` trailer
that `injectIssueRef` appends below them is not part of the section. The renderer normalises the order
when it snapshots the body; nothing in the authored body depends on it.

#### Block authoring contract

Every runnable block must sit under a versioned `## [x.y.z]` release entry. `bin/migrate` runs it from
the consumer project, with `HARNESS_DIR` exported; invoke harness files through
`"${HARNESS_DIR}/bin/..."`, never `./bin/...`.

Blocks must not force-remove a Git worktree or branch (`git worktree remove --force`, `git branch -D`),
and must not start, stop, restart, or kill a daemon. Print an instruction for the operator to take a
daemon lifecycle action instead. `test/test_harness_integrity.sh` rejects these forms before release and
reports the offending line and contract clause.

## Waivers

When the path-based classifier flags a breaking surface but the actual edit is internal-only — deleting a
private helper, with no consumer-visible CLI, hook, or schema change — a migration block is the wrong
artifact. Commit a waiver instead.

Do **not** waive when the edit changes actual CLI, hook, or schema *behavior*. That always needs a real
migration block.

### File format

Write the file at `.docs/release-waivers/<plan-stem>.md`:

```text
Waives: <comma-separated canonical surface names>

Rationale: <non-empty prose — why this is internal-only>
```

The parser is strict, and every rejection makes the whole waiver malformed rather than partially valid:

| Condition | Result |
| --- | --- |
| No `Waives:` line | Malformed |
| No `Rationale:`, or a whitespace-only rationale | Malformed |
| An empty surface list after comma-splitting and trimming | Malformed |
| Any surface name not a verbatim member of `CANONICAL_BREAKING_SURFACES` | Malformed |

Surface names must match the four strings above exactly. An unknown name is never silently accepted.

### Coverage

`uncovered = surfaces.filter(s => !parsed.surfaces.includes(s))`. Any classified surface the waiver does
not list HALTs, naming the gap. Partial coverage is not partial credit — the waiver must list every
touched breaking surface.

### Freshness

The waiver must appear in this change set: a file under `.docs/release-waivers/` ending in `.md` whose
git status starts with `A` or `M`. A waiver merged by a prior feature can never satisfy a later one.

When no waiver appears in the diff, the gate still probes the conventional path
`.docs/release-waivers/self-host-release-gate-bin-conduct-breaking-surfac.md`, because the composed gate
is not told which feature is building and has no directory-listing seam. A file found there but absent
from the diff produces the not-fresh HALT: "a waiver merged by a prior feature can never satisfy a new
breaking change set; commit the waiver in this diff."

### Uncertain change sets are unwaivable

When `classifyBreakingSurfaces` returns `uncertain: true`, `runReleaseArtifactGate` writes the migration
HALT and returns without ever consulting the waiver path — an undeterminable diff cannot prove freshness,
so it never even mentions that a waiver exists.

## Pull request expectations

`.github/pull_request_template.md` carries five sections: **Summary**, **Release metadata**,
**Migration** (answer it even when the answer is `none`), **Documentation**, and **Test plan**. The
Release metadata section defaults to `Release-Disposition: no-note`; a notable reader-visible change
replaces it with `Release-Disposition: note` plus `Release-Category`, `Release-Semver`, and
`Release-Note`. A required check validates this section on every PR open/update. Its checkboxes are:

- Canonical affected documentation updated, or not applicable
- README landing-page contract updated, or not affected
- `test/test_harness_integrity.sh` passes
- Manually verified affected skill, hook, or CLI

### The `semver:` band

The same check stamps the impact it just validated onto the PR as a `semver:major`,
`semver:minor`, or `semver:patch` label, so an operator can read merge order straight off
the PR list instead of opening each body. `no-note` PRs carry no band — they never move
`VERSION`, and a fourth "none" band would read as a release decision they did not make.

The stamp is a REPLACE: editing a body from `minor` to `patch` retracts the stale band, so a
PR never shows two contradictory ones. It is also strictly downstream of validation — an
invalid disposition fails the check and leaves labels untouched, and a label-apply failure
(auth, rate limit, network) is logged but never fails the required check.

All work happens in an isolated git worktree on a feature branch. Create both before making
changes; a feature branch in the primary checkout is not sufficient. Never commit directly to `main`.
