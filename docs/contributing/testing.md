# Testing

Every test tier in this repo, the command that runs it, and the isolation policy that decides which tier
a new test belongs in. For contributors adding or debugging tests.

Test *authoring* rules — how to pick a seam, bound a conductor fixture, keep time deterministic — live in
[`.agents/skills/write-tests/SKILL.md`](../../.agents/skills/write-tests/SKILL.md), which this repo
mandates for anyone touching tests. This page describes the suite; that skill describes the craft.

## Commands

Run everything from `src/conductor` unless stated otherwise.

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Install dependencies | `cd src/conductor && npm ci` |
| Full suite (what CI runs) | `cd src/conductor && npm test` |
| One Vitest file while authoring | `cd src/conductor && npm test -- test/<path>.test.ts` |
| Engineer lifecycle CLI (`node:test`) | `cd src/conductor && npm run test:node` |
| Watch mode | `cd src/conductor && npm run test:watch` |
| Type check (`src/` only) | `cd src/conductor && npm run typecheck` |
| Type check including `test/` | `cd src/conductor && npm run typecheck:test` |
| Lint TypeScript | `cd src/conductor && npm run lint` (`npm run lint:fix` to autofix) |
| Lint shell scripts | `bash test/lint_shell.sh` (from the repo root) |
| Check documentation links | `lychee --config lychee.toml docs README.md AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md src/conductor/README.md` |
| Build the engine | `cd src/conductor && npm run build` |
| Structural integrity of the repo | `bash test/test_harness_integrity.sh` (from the repo root) |

From the repository root, `make check` installs the lockfile-pinned Conductor dependencies when they
are missing or stale, then runs both TypeScript checks above.

`npm test` with no selectors runs:

```bash
node scripts/run-vitest.mjs run --reporter=dot --silent --slowTestThreshold=1800000 &&
npm run test:node &&
echo 'AGGREGATE_TEST_SUITE_PASS'
```

`AGGREGATE_TEST_SUITE_PASS` is a human-readable shell success indicator. The pre-SHIP `test_suite`
gate classifies the aggregate command's exit code and records its evidence; it does not inspect this
sentinel. The package script is also the containment boundary that creates the run-scoped temp root
before Vitest loads, so use `npm test -- <selectors>` rather than invoking `vitest run` directly.

New Engineer lifecycle CLI behavior tests use `node:test` with `node:assert/strict` and live directly
under `test/`. `vitest.config.ts` excludes that file to prevent dual discovery, while the no-argument
`npm test` aggregate runs it after the main Vitest suite. Use `npm run test:node`
for a focused run.

### The engine-dist guard

Thirteen test files spawn the real `bin/ai-conductor`, which exits 1 when `src/conductor/dist` is
missing or its symlink dangles. `dist` is gitignored, so it does not exist in a fresh clone or
`git worktree` after `npm ci`, and there is no `pretest` hook — nothing built it before the tests
ran. It appeared only partway through a run, whenever some test happened to publish an engine, and
every real-binary test scheduled before that point failed on exit 1.

`test/global-setup.ts` now calls `ensureEngineDist` (`test/engine-dist-guard.ts`) before the first
test: it builds the engine when `dist` does not resolve and is a no-op otherwise, so a warm checkout
pays nothing. When it builds, it prints `engine-dist-guard: built the engine before the run`. You do
not need to run `npm run build` by hand before `npm test`.

This presents as flakiness — a cold worktree fails a handful of real-binary tests, and every re-run
afterwards is green with no code change. If you see that pattern, check whether `dist` resolves
before assuming a race in the code under test.

### Deterministic daemon end-to-end fixture

`test/engine/daemon-e2e-fixture.test.ts` drives a committed fixture from
`test/fixtures/daemon-e2e/` through the real daemon claim, Conductor build,
evidence, completion-gate, and local finish path. A scripted provider fake is
the only external boundary; it makes real local Git commits while the internal
pipeline remains production code. The negative case proves missing task
evidence halts instead of completing.

This test runs in ordinary CI without a separate workflow job.
`vitest.config.ts` includes `test/**/*.test.ts` and excludes only smoke paths
and `*.smoke.test.ts` names, so the existing `conductor` job's `npm test`
invocation runs it and reports through `ci-gate`.

### Live-provider daemon E2E smoke

`test/engine/daemon-e2e-live-claude.smoke.test.ts` and
`test/engine/daemon-e2e-live-codex.smoke.test.ts` are the opt-in real-provider
legs over that deterministic fixture. They select provider descriptors and
share one run body in `test/fixtures/live-e2e-run-body.ts`. Before dispatch,
that body provisions an isolated provider home from
`test/fixtures/live-provider-home.ts` (skills copied from the checkout under
test, never operator state) and preflights every registry-rendered step command
via `test/fixtures/step-command-preflight.ts`. An unresolved skill fails before
any provider dispatch or token spend. Each leg asserts the same successful
terminal state (`DONE`, with no `HALT` or park marker), fixture commit, and
`Task: 1` trailer, and reports its observed spend under the shared
`DAEMON_E2E_LIVE_TOKEN_CAP` (default `300000`). On failure, both use the shared
`dumpPipelineDiagnostics` helper to print the daemon log, halt reason, task
status, task evidence, and park markers.

CI sources that cap from the repository Actions variable named
`DAEMON_E2E_LIVE_TOKEN_CAP`, falling back to `300000` when the variable is
unset. Change the repository variable to recalibrate the release gate without
editing the workflow; the same value continues to govern both provider legs.

Each leg needs its matching binary and credential: `claude` with
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, or `codex` with `CODEX_API_KEY`. Set
`SMOKE_FORCE_SKIP=capability:credentialed:claude` or
`SMOKE_FORCE_SKIP=capability:credentialed:codex` to skip one local provider
leg. An absent credential is a named non-gating skip; a present credential
makes that provider leg gate-enforced. Run either leg directly from
`src/conductor`:

```bash
npm run smoke -- test/engine/daemon-e2e-live-claude.smoke.test.ts
```

The reusable [Live daemon E2E workflow](../../.github/workflows/live-daemon-e2e.yml)
runs one matrix leg per provider, selecting only that provider's smoke file.
Each leg records its result independently, and the release gate requires at
least one provider leg to pass; a failure from one provider remains visible but
does not block publication when the other provider succeeds. The non-provider
smoke tier remains independently mandatory. The separate
`require-live-provider-credential` job requires at least one provider
credential overall. To add a provider, add its descriptor, its provider-specific
smoke file, and its matrix entry in the same change; do not create a parallel
live-E2E workflow.

## Linters

Three linters run in CI, each scoped to what `tsc` and `bash -n` cannot tell you.

**Errors only — there is no advisory tier.** Every enabled rule fails the build. Nothing is configured
to `warn`: a rule too noisy to run at `error` is turned off outright and the reason recorded, because a
warning nobody reads only teaches people to ignore the tool. `npm run lint` runs with
`--max-warnings=0`; ShellCheck runs at `--severity=error` and never prints info/style findings. A clean
run prints almost nothing.

| Linter | Config | Scope | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ESLint (typescript-eslint, type-aware) | `src/conductor/eslint.config.mjs` | `src/**/*.ts` **and** `test/**/*.ts` | `no-floating-promises`, `await-thenable`, `no-misused-promises` (with `checksVoidReturn.arguments` off) |
| ShellCheck | `test/lint_shell.sh` | `bin/**` (by shell shebang), `hooks/**/*.sh`, `test/*.sh`, `.github/scripts/*.sh` | `--severity=error` |
| lychee | `lychee.toml` | `docs/`, `README.md`, `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `src/conductor/README.md` | internal links only (offline) |

The ESLint rule set is deliberately tiny. `strict: true` already covers the ground a stock preset
would, so the only rules enabled are ones `tsc` structurally cannot provide: promises created and
then dropped. This is an async daemon on execa/chokidar, where a dropped promise does not throw —
it presents as a silent stall.

No formatter is configured, deliberately: Prettier or Biome across ~85k lines would produce a diff
that buries every real change.

`no-misused-promises` runs with `checksVoidReturn.arguments` disabled. With it on it fires 90 times,
every one of them an async callback passed to a void-return API (`process.on('SIGINT', handler)`,
commander `.action()`), where the only available fix is a `void` wrapper that changes nothing at
runtime. `require-await` is not enabled for the same reason: 40 hits, dominated by `async` functions
that conform to an awaited interface without needing `await` themselves.

ShellCheck's `error` floor is the bar the tree passes today, chosen so the gate enforces from the day
it lands instead of being advisory. Deferred: 91 findings at `warning`, 171 at `info`, 191 at `style`.
Raising it is not mechanical — 45 of the 91 warnings are SC2319 against the deliberate
`assert "desc" "$(cmd; echo $?)"` idiom used throughout the bash suite.

`CHANGELOG.md` is excluded from link checking on purpose: an entry correctly names the document that
existed when it was written, so entries pointing at since-deleted pages are history, not rot.

Tests are linted on the same terms as engine source. ESLint resolves types through
`tsconfig.test.json`, not `tsconfig.json` — the latter excludes `test/`, which would make the project
service fail to resolve every test file and report 599 parse errors instead of linting them.

`no-floating-promises` matters more in a test than in engine code: an unawaited promise in a test does
not fail the test, it leaks async work into whichever test runs next, which is how a suite starts
failing in groups but passing in isolation.

## Test tiers

Test files live under `src/conductor/test/`. Vitest includes `test/**/*.test.ts` except smoke paths and
the flat `node:test` Engineer lifecycle CLI suite. The aggregate `npm test` command runs both test
runners, so every tier below except smoke remains part of the default gate.

| Directory | Files | Covers | Run just this tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `test/engine/` | 494 | Mirrors `src/engine/`, including subdirectories for `engineer/`, `engineer/intake/`, `self-host/`, `otel/`, `halt-issues/`, `owner-gate/`. | `npm test -- test/engine` |
| `test/acceptance/` | 175 | Observable story and gate behavior across the minimum real internal path, with third-party boundaries faked. | `npm test -- test/acceptance` |
| `test/` (top level) | 71 | Cross-cutting suites not owned by one layer: `wiring-*`, `build-progress-*`, `backlog-priority`, `config-validation`, and tests of the leak guards themselves. | `npm test -- 'test/*.test.ts'` |
| `test/integration/` | 41 | Real collaboration between internal components; real temp files or local git only where git semantics are the subject. | `npm test -- test/integration` |
| `test/ui/` | 14 | Renderers, subscribers, dashboard snapshot and text, live region, prompt host. | `npm test -- test/ui` |
| `test/execution/` | 25 | Provider adapters, the `LLMProvider` contract, token usage, rate-limit parsing, sessions. | `npm test -- test/execution` |
| `test/smoke/` | 4 | Real binaries and real third parties. Excluded by default; seven additional `*.smoke.test.ts` files live beside the subsystem they exercise. | See [Smoke tests](#smoke-tests). |
| `test/cli/` | 6 | CLI entry-point and argument behavior. | `npm test -- test/cli` |
| `test/structural/` | 8 | Meta-tests that parse the suite itself. See [Structural meta-tests](#structural-meta-tests). | `npm test -- test/structural` |
| `test/types/` | 3 | Type-level contracts. | `npm test -- test/types` |
| `test/fixtures/` | 5 | Fixture helpers and their executable contract tests. | `npm test -- test/fixtures` |

Runner shape (`src/conductor/vitest.config.ts`): `pool: 'forks'` with top-level `maxWorkers: 2`,
`testTimeout: 20000`, `hookTimeout: 30000`, `environment: 'node'`. No reporter is configured in the file
— it comes from the command line. Vitest 4 removed `poolOptions` and `minWorkers`; isolated generated
smoke fixtures set `maxWorkers: 1`.

`npm run typecheck` covers `src/` only — `src/conductor/tsconfig.json` sets
`"exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "test"]`. `npm run typecheck:test` (`tsconfig.test.json`) covers
`src/` **and** `test/`, and CI runs both. Use it to check the test you just wrote; Vitest transpiles
without type-checking, so it will happily run a test that does not compile.

## Isolation policy

The rule, in one line: a test may reach a third party only if it is an explicitly named smoke test.

| Level | May use | Must fake |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | The function, class, transition, or adapter contract under test. | Every process, network, LLM, GitHub, and filesystem boundary not under test — injected as a mocked adapter. |
| Integration | Real collaboration between internal components; real temp files and local git when git semantics are the subject. | Every third party. |
| Acceptance | The real application entry point, real internal wiring, locally controlled infrastructure. | Every third-party boundary, replaced with a faithful fake through the production adapter seam. |
| Smoke | The real binary or service. | Nothing — that is the point. Must live in `test/smoke/` or be named `*.smoke.test.ts`, and is excluded from the default command and CI. |

"Third party" means LLM providers, hosted APIs, GitHub, email and payment services, webhooks, package
registries, and other network services. The policy text is `HARNESS.md:303-310`, restated at repo level
in `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md:60-64`.

### Project teardown acceptance coverage

`test/acceptance/project-teardown-hook.acceptance.test.ts` exercises the project-supplied
`bin/teardown` hook through real local Git worktrees and executable scripts. It covers post-ship
reaping, operator reclaim, and parked reconciliation while faking only GitHub and shipped-record
boundaries. The hook's environment, ordering before removal, contained non-zero exits, retained
worktree skip, and configured timeout are observable assertions. Run it with:

```bash
cd src/conductor && npm test -- test/acceptance/project-teardown-hook.acceptance.test.ts
```

### Worktree-removal classification guard

`test/structural/worktree-removal-coverage.test.ts` parses every production source module and detects
real `git worktree remove` calls. When adding or moving a removal path, run the guard and classify the
**calling module** before landing it:

1. Route a path that removes a provisioned feature worktree through `runProjectTeardown` before its
   removal call.
2. Otherwise add the module to that test's `WORKTREE_REMOVAL_EXEMPTIONS` registry with a specific,
   non-empty reason. An exemption must still contain a real removal call; stale entries fail.
3. Do not add teardown to the shared `worktree-shared.removeWorktree` primitive. Its callers have
   different scope, so the primitive is deliberately an exempt pass-through and each caller is
   classified separately.

An unclassified path, a routed path with no teardown invitation, or a stale/empty exemption fails the
standard suite. This is the enforcement described by
`.docs/decisions/adr-2026-08-07-worktree-removal-coverage-guard.md`. Run it directly with:

```bash
cd src/conductor && npm test -- test/structural/worktree-removal-coverage.test.ts
```

## Global guards

Four files run automatically and exist because each one prevented a real incident.

### vitest.config.ts — the run-scoped `TMPDIR`

`scripts/run-vitest.mjs` creates one `ai-conductor-vitest-run-*` root beneath the ignored,
checkout-local `src/conductor/.vitest-tmp/` directory and points `TMPDIR` at it before loading
Vitest. The config module then idempotently reuses that root. To select another writable filesystem,
set `AI_CONDUCTOR_TEST_TMP_BASE` to an absolute path before running the suite:

```bash
cd src/conductor
AI_CONDUCTOR_TEST_TMP_BASE=/var/tmp/ai-conductor-tests npm test
```

An explicitly blank, relative, or NUL-containing override stops startup; the runner does not fall
back to the system temporary directory.

`os.tmpdir()` reads `TMPDIR` on every call, so all ~1,426 `mkdtemp(join(tmpdir(), '<prefix>-'))` call
sites across the suite — including ones written later — land inside that root with no test-file changes,
and `global-setup.ts` deletes the root wholesale at teardown. Before this, the tests that never cleaned
up left tens of thousands of directories in the operator's real `/tmp`; on a tmpfs that exhausted inodes
and broke unrelated production processes with `ENOSPC`.

The package runner must install it before Vitest loads because Vitest 4 creates its root `tmpDir`
before evaluating the config; `globalSetup` is later still. A later redirect leaves Vitest's own
random-named SSR cache in the real tmpdir every run. `test/tmpdir-redirect-propagation.test.ts` runs
inside a forked worker and asserts `os.tmpdir()` resolves to the run root, so the env propagation this
all depends on is proven rather than assumed.

None of this excuses a fixture from cleaning up after itself — it bounds the damage when one does not.

Before it takes the original-temporary-directory baseline, `global-setup.ts` also reaps stale
`ai-conductor-vitest-run-*` roots left by an interrupted earlier run from both the original
temporary directory and the selected storage location. Each live root has an owner marker refreshed
every minute; marked roots are eligible after three hours, while legacy unmarked roots wait 24
hours. The sweep retains its own root, live roots, unreadable markers, and every non-directory
prefixed entry (including symlinks), and reports but does not fail the new run when it cannot remove
a candidate. This keeps abandoned test artifacts from accumulating without risking a live run or a
symlink target.

### setup.ts

`src/conductor/test/setup.ts` runs before every test file (`setupFiles`) and sets three process-wide
kill-switches:

- `NO_AUTOLAUNCH_ENV=1` — the engineer handoff's default launch path becomes a no-op, so no test spawns a
  real `tmux new-session -d 'ai-conductor daemon --continuous'` that outlives its tmpdir.
- `AI_CONDUCTOR_NO_REAL_EXEC=1` — `makeProductionGh` and `makeProductionGit` refuse to exec. A test once
  added a `needs-remediation` label and a `boom` comment to a live PR; this is the guard against that.
- `AI_CONDUCTOR_ENGINEER_DIR` — redirected to a fresh `mkdtempSync` directory unless a test already set
  it, so nothing writes into the operator's real `~/.ai-conductor/engineer/`.

### global-setup.ts

`src/conductor/test/global-setup.ts` snapshots state before the run and diffs it after:

- `.pipeline` under the test cwd — any added or modified file throws
  `` `.pipeline leak into <cwd> during test run: …` ``.
- Daemon tmux sessions — leaked `cc-daemon-*` sessions are reaped; a killed session fails the run, an
  `indeterminate` one is logged non-fatally.
- The real engineer signals store — a `test-project`-tagged line that leaked into it throws.
- The original temporary directory's top-level entries — anything that appeared during the run
  and is neither known concurrent-tooling noise (`self-host-*`, `claude-*`, …) throws
  `tmpdir-leak-guard: N temp entry/entries leaked into the REAL tmpdir …`. That is a temp dir the
  `TMPDIR` redirect did not contain: a hardcoded `/tmp`, an `os.tmpdir()` value cached before the
  redirect, or a subprocess spawned without the inherited env. Fix the call site; widening
  `IGNORED_TMPDIR_PREFIXES` is only for a genuine false positive from a new concurrent tool.

The parked-marker leak guard (#1251) runs last of all, after the tmpdir check, so any more specific
guard failure still throws first. It resolves the real repository's `.daemon/parked` directory (via
`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, so it finds the main checkout's ledger from any worktree), snapshots
the marker files there before the run, and diffs them after. Any slug added, removed, or modified in the
real ledger throws `` `park-leak-guard: parked marker ledger changed during test run: …` `` — a fixture
that resolved the real ledger instead of a redirected one and parked or unparked a slug in it. It never
repairs the ledger it detects a change in. An unexpected error while checking it is fail-safe, not
fail-closed: it is logged as `park-leak-guard: NOT enforced (fail-safe): …` rather than failing the run,
because the guard's own resolution logic (a `git` subprocess) can legitimately fail outside the ledger
itself.

It also sweeps stale tmpdir-rooted daemon sessions before the run and installs a best-effort SIGINT and
SIGTERM reap, because Vitest's global teardown only fires on a normal exit.

### Leak guards

`test/pipeline-leak-guard.ts`, `test/signals-leak-guard.ts`, `test/tmux-leak-guard.ts`,
`test/tmpdir-leak-guard.ts`, and `test/park-leak-guard.ts` hold the snapshot and diff logic. The tmux guard is fail-closed by design: killing a session requires both that
the baseline snapshot succeeded and that the pane cwd resolves and is tmpdir-rooted. Missing either
signal leaves the session running and logs `tmux-leak-guard: NOT killed (fail-closed): …`.

`test/test-conductor.ts` is the shared Conductor test double. It extends the production `Conductor` with
a passing full-suite verifier so ordinary fixtures do not trip the native aggregate gate.

## Structural meta-tests

`test/structural/` enforces the isolation policy mechanically. Read it before adding a test that touches
a process.

**`test-execution-policy.test.ts`** parses every `.ts` under `test/` with the TypeScript compiler,
excluding itself, `smoke/`, and `*.smoke.test.ts`, and fails on forbidden process calls. It watches
`exec`, `execFile`, `execFileSync`, `execSync`, `spawn`, `spawnSync`, `execa`, and `execaCommand`, and
rejects:

- `claude`, `codex`, `curl`, `wget` as the executable;
- `npm install` or `npm ci`; `npx claude|codex`; `npm exec claude|codex`;
- any `gh` invocation carrying a network subcommand (`api`, `auth`, `cache`, `gist`, `issue`, `label`,
  `pr`, `project`, `release`, `repo`, `run`, `search`, `secret`, `variable`, `workflow`);
- `bin/setup` in any form, including `join('bin', 'setup')`.

The same test re-reads `vitest.config.ts` and reports
`vitest.config.ts: default run includes smoke tests` if either exclusion glob has been removed.

**`fixture-portability.test.ts`** requires `git init -b <branch>` in all four exec shapes unless the call
is `--bare`, commented out, or annotated `// portability-ok: <reason>`. It also flags `.unref()` under
`src/engine/**` and hardcoded absolute `/tmp/...` string literals — use `os.tmpdir()`.

**`module-header-caller-claims.test.ts`** scans leading comment blocks in `src/engine/**` for explicit
no-caller claims (`nothing imports`, `no callers`/`no importers`, inert-module claims, and `nothing`
calling, using, or invoking a backticked identifier). It fails only when a relative import or symbol
reference contradicts a claim; truthful claims and matching prose below the leading comment block pass.

## Smoke tests

Smoke tests are excluded from `npm test` by the two globs in `vitest.config.ts`. Run the complete,
glob-discovered smoke tier from `src/conductor`:

```bash
npm run smoke
```

The smoke config includes `test/smoke/**` and every `*.smoke.test.ts` file. It currently discovers ten
files. Each declares exactly one required capability beside the test:

| Capability | Current files | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermetic` | `finish-record`, `surgical-finish-retry` | No external binary or credential. |
| `toolchain` | `publish-interrupted`, `backlog-priority`, `codex-provider`, `daemon-tmux` | A local toolchain or network-backed setup. |
| `credentialed:claude` | `claude-provider`, `build-token-auth`, `daemon-e2e-live-claude` | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. |
| `credentialed:codex` | `daemon-e2e-live-codex` | `CODEX_API_KEY`. |

`publish-interrupted.smoke.test.ts` is `toolchain`, not hermetic: it creates a worktree and runs the
real `bin/setup`, which may install dependencies. Select one production smoke file with
`npm run smoke -- <smoke_file>`. `npm run smoke` runs in advisory mode by default
(`SMOKE_MODE` unset or anything but `gate`): a file whose capability is unmet — no toolchain binary
or that provider's credential — is skipped, not failed, and a run that executed zero smoke assertions
for a file still fails that file. Set `SMOKE_MODE=gate` for the fail-closed release variant: a complete-tier
run fails when any required capability is unmet, and it requires at least one executed
`credentialed:claude` or `credentialed:codex` file — an all-skipped credentialed tier can never pass.
A selected credentialed file whose credential is absent is instead a passing non-gating skip; when its
credential is present, that selected leg must execute and remains gate-enforced. `SMOKE_FORCE_SKIP` (comma-
separated `capability:<name>` or `file:<path>` entries) forces an operator override in either mode;
in gate mode a forced skip still counts as a failure. Every run ends with one `smoke ledger:` line per
file naming its capability and outcome (`ran`, `skipped (unmet: …)`, or `failed (evidence: …)`).

Keep the normal `vitest.config.ts` exclusions intact: ordinary unit and integration runs must never
execute smoke tests.

## Bash test scripts

40 `.sh` files live under `test/`. Only six ever execute:

- `test/test_harness_integrity.sh`, run by CI and by the BUILD `test_suite` gate. See
  [validation](validation.md).
- `test/test_ci_detect_docs_only.sh` and `test/test_provider_skill_contracts.sh`, executed by the
  integrity suite as checks 13 and 14.
- `test/test_docs_navigation.sh` and `test/test_docs_pages_smoke.sh`, executed by the integrity
  suite as check 17. `test_docs_navigation.sh` in turn shells out to `test/check_docs_navigation.sh`,
  the offline contract checker it validates against fixture and real-tree cases.

### ripgrep is optional, and skipping is silent

`rg` is not required to run the suite, but three scripts scope their own coverage on it and say so
only in their output: `test/test_bin_migrate_approval.sh` and
`test/test_bin_migrate_multi_version_jump.sh` print `SKIP` and exit 0, and integrity check 12b
records a pass while skipping `test/test_release_pr_workflow.sh`. On a checkout without ripgrep the
suite therefore runs smaller than CI does — CI installs it (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — while still
reporting green. `bin/install --check` warns when `rg` is missing; nothing the harness ships at
runtime needs it.

`test/docs_pages.smoke.test.sh` is a real, opt-in Pages probe — run it by hand after a default-branch
deployment; it is never invoked from integrity or CI. `test/run_browsable_documentation_site_acceptance.sh`
runs `test_docs_navigation.sh` and `test_docs_pages_smoke.sh` together as the deterministic acceptance
suite for the hosted documentation site story; nothing invokes it automatically.

> **Known limitation.** The rest — `test_bin_update.sh`, `test_conduct_worktree.sh`, the five
> `test_install_*.sh`, the ten `test_examples_*.sh`, `test_skill_pipeline_contract.sh`,
> `test_release_unreleased_state.sh`, `docs_pages.smoke.test.sh`, and
> `run_browsable_documentation_site_acceptance.sh` — are statically checked only: `bash -n` by integrity
> check 1 and ShellCheck by check 1b. Nothing *executes* them, in CI or locally, and no documented
> command runs them as a suite. Static analysis raises the floor but does not make them tests: a
> behavioral regression in `bin/install`, `bin/update`, or `bin/setup` is still caught by no automated
> gate. Run the relevant script by hand (`bash test/test_bin_update.sh`) when you change those surfaces.
> Tracked in [#1021](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1021).

`examples/` holds runnable end-to-end scenarios (`interactive.sh`, `daemon.sh`,
`engineer.sh`, `intake-loop.sh`, each taking a tier `s|m|l`). Each creates a throwaway sandbox via
`sandbox_up` and tears it down on exit. They invoke real flows, are not run by CI, and are not a scored
regression suite.

## The aggregate gate

`test_suite` is a real step in the linear sequence, not just a command. The engine reads its contract
from `.ai-conductor/config.yml`:

```yaml
test_suite:
  commands:
    - command: npm test
      working_directory: src/conductor
    - command: test/test_harness_integrity.sh
      working_directory: .
  timeout_seconds: 1800
```

The entries run in order, so the integrity suite runs only after the conductor suite passes. The
`--slowTestThreshold=1800000` in the npm script matches that 1800-second budget, suppressing slow-test
warnings that would otherwise fire on every long run.

For where `test_suite` sits in the flow and what happens when it fails, see

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests targeting `main`:

1. `changes` — computes `docs_only` by piping `git diff --name-only BASE HEAD` through
   `.github/scripts/ci-detect-docs-only.sh`.
2. `integrity` — skipped when `docs_only` is true; installs `shellcheck`, then runs
   `bash test/test_harness_integrity.sh`.
3. `shellcheck` — skipped when `docs_only` is true; runs `bash test/lint_shell.sh`, the same script
   integrity check 1b calls.
4. `lint` — skipped when `docs_only` is true; `npm ci` then `npm run lint` in `src/conductor`.
5. `typecheck` — `npm ci` then `npm run typecheck` in `src/conductor`.
6. `conductor` — `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm test` in `src/conductor`.
7. `links` — **never skipped.** Checks documentation links via `lycheeverse/lychee-action`.
8. `ci-gate` — `if: always()`; fails when any of the above is `failure` or `cancelled`. This is the
   required-status aggregator.

`links` is deliberately the one job with no `docs_only` gate. `docs_only` is true only when every
changed path is under `.docs/` (the internal spec-artifact tree) — see
`.github/scripts/ci-detect-docs-only.sh` — and such a pull request skips every other job here. A link
checker carrying the same gate would inherit that hole. Leaving it ungated also means the guarantee
survives any future widening of the predicate, and it costs about six seconds with no npm install and
no network.

Node comes from `src/conductor/.tool-versions` (`nodejs 26.7.0`) and the npm cache keys on
`src/conductor/package-lock.json`.
