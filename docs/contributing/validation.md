# Validation

The structural integrity suite — `test/test_harness_integrity.sh` — check by check: what each one
verifies, what makes it fail, and how to fix it. For contributors whose commit just went red.

This page covers the integrity script only. Runtime gates that block a feature's progression are
[gates](../explanation/gates.md); per-step enforcement values are [steps](../reference/steps.md).

## Running it

```bash
bash test/test_harness_integrity.sh
```

Run it from the worktree root when validating a harness change. It takes no arguments;
validation is required before declaring the work complete, not before each commit.

Two result classes:

- `assert` failures print `FAIL`, increment the failure count, and make the script exit 1.
- `warn_check` failures print `WARN` and are counted separately. They **never** change the exit code.

The summary line reports `N passed  N failed  N warnings  (N total)`. Only the failure count matters for
exit status.

Install engine dependencies first, or three checks silently degrade:

```bash
cd src/conductor && npm ci
```

Without `src/conductor/node_modules`, checks 5a, 5b, and 5c WARN-skip with these exact lines, and you
lose local coverage that CI still enforces:

```text
src/conductor/node_modules absent — skipping model-table drift check
model-table checks skipped — run npm install in src/conductor
src/conductor/node_modules absent — skipping docs-guard hook drift check
```

Check 5b additionally needs `jq` on `PATH`; without it you get
`model-table pin check skipped — jq not installed`.

## The checks

In file order. Sections 1, 2, 5, and 9 carry lettered sub-checks, and four checks are unnumbered in the script.

| # | Verifies | Fails when | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | The repository root has no `package-lock.json`. The Node project lives under `src/conductor/`; a root lockfile would describe no installable package and mislead dependency tooling about that boundary. | `package-lock.json` exists at the repository root. | Remove the stray root lockfile; run `npm ci` inside `src/conductor/` instead. |
| 1 | `bash -n` over `bin/*` (only files whose first line matches `bash`), `hooks/claude/*.sh`, `test/*.sh`, and `.github/scripts/*.sh`. | Any of those scripts has a syntax error. | Fix the syntax. A `bin/` file with a non-bash shebang is skipped entirely, not checked. |
| 1b | ShellCheck at `--severity=error` over the script set enumerated by `test/lint_shell.sh` (`bin/*` by shebang, plus `hooks/**/*.sh`, `test/*.sh`, `.github/scripts/*.sh`). Where check 1 proves a script *parses*, this catches shell bugs that parse fine and misbehave at runtime. | Any finding at `error` severity (exit 1), or the enumeration returns zero scripts (exit 2 — the gate refuses to report success on an empty set). | Run `test/lint_shell.sh` and fix what it names. Threshold and deferred warning/info/style counts are documented in that script's header. |
| 1c | No tracked text source file (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.json`, `.sh`, `.md`, `.yml`, `.yaml`) contains a raw NUL byte. A committed NUL makes the file *binary* to the whole search toolchain, and every tool fails silently: `grep` (shimmed to `ugrep -I` in agent sessions) and recursive `rg` skip it entirely — no match, no count line, no warning, exit 1. That reads as "the symbol does not exist", which has already caused a live misdiagnosis (2026-08-20, `build-review-domain.ts:84`). | Any listed file contains a NUL byte. | Replace the raw byte with the `\u0000` escape, which is semantically identical: `perl -0777 -pi -e 's/\000/\\u0000/g' <file>`. Detection is by construction (stripping NULs changes the file iff it had one) because a NUL cannot be passed as a `grep` pattern argument at all. |
| 2 | Every `skills/*/SKILL.md` opens with `---` and its frontmatter contains `name:`, `description:`, `enforcement:`, `phase:`. | The delimiter or any required field is missing. | Add the field. See [skills](../reference/skills.md). |
| 2a | `test/check_skill_invocation_policy.sh` verifies every shipped and repository-local skill has exactly one invocation classification, and `test/test_skill_invocation_policy.sh` mutation-tests that audit. The fixed implicit-required set carries one canonical `implicit_invocation: required` marker and no host disable; every other skill carries Claude `disable-model-invocation: true` plus Codex `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`. The observed exception set must exactly equal the verified same-session dependency allowlist. | A host policy is missing, duplicated, noncanonical, or contradictory; a local skill is omitted; the implicit-required set drifts in either direction; or the checker accepts a representative invalid mutation. | Classify the caller first. Keep implicit invocation only when another loaded skill must activate the workflow in the same session; otherwise add both host disable controls. Update the fixed allowlist and [skills reference](../reference/skills.md#invocation-policy) together when a verified composition dependency changes. |
| 3 | Every `agents/[a-z_-]*.md` string appearing in `skills/`, `HARNESS.md`, or `ARCHITECTURE.md` exists on disk. | A referenced agent file is missing. | Create the agent file or fix the reference. |
| 4 | Every backticked `` `/name` `` reference in `skills/*/SKILL.md` maps to a `skills/<name>/` directory, or is named in the script's `KNOWN_NON_SKILL_REFS` allowlist (`quit`, `skill-name`). | A reference resolves to no skill directory and is not allowlisted — a dangling pointer left behind by a renamed or deleted skill. | Fix the reference to name a real skill, or — if it genuinely names a host command or a syntax placeholder, not a skill — add it to `KNOWN_NON_SKILL_REFS` with a comment naming where it is used. |
| 5 | Every `skills/*/` directory name matches `\| <name>[ (\|]` somewhere in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. | Never — this is a `warn_check`. | Add a model-table row and regenerate. |
| 5a | `bin/generate-model-table --check` reports no drift between the generated ARCHITECTURE.md table region and `model-table-metadata.ts` + `resolved-config.ts`. Plus a fixture sub-test that corrupts a temp copy's Codex provider label and requires exit 1 *and* a unified diff naming both the changed and the canonical header line. | Exit 1 (drift), exit 2 (environment error), or any other non-zero exit. The fixture fails if `--check` cannot produce a useful diff. | Run `bin/generate-model-table` and commit the rewritten ARCHITECTURE.md region. Never hand-edit rows between the `BEGIN GENERATED: model-selection-table` and `END GENERATED` markers. |
| 5b | For every `skills/*/SKILL.md` carrying a `model:` frontmatter line, the pin equals `.expected` from `bin/generate-model-table --pins`. Entries with `.exempt == true` pass without comparison. | The pin disagrees with expected; a pinned skill is absent from `--pins` (reported as "unmapped"); or `--pins` emits unparseable JSON. | Fix the pin, or map the skill in `SKILL_STEP_MAP` / exempt it in `PIN_EXEMPT_SKILLS` (`src/conductor/src/engine/model-table-metadata.ts`). |
| 5c | `bin/generate-docs-guard-hook --check` reports no drift between the committed `hooks/claude/docs-guard.sh` and `src/conductor/src/engine/session-hook-assets.ts`. Plus a fixture sub-test that appends a corrupting comment to the hook and requires exit 1. | Exit 1, 2, or any other non-zero exit; or the corrupted fixture is not detected. | Edit the TypeScript source, run `bin/generate-docs-guard-hook`, commit the regenerated `.sh`. Never hand-edit the hook. |
| 6 | Every `templates/[a-z_.-]*.template` string in `skills/`, `HARNESS.md`, or `ARCHITECTURE.md` exists on disk. | A referenced template is missing. | Create it or fix the reference. |
| 7 | Per SKILL.md, no two `### <n>` headings share an identifier. Sub-markers are kept, so `### 2.` and `### 2.5` — or `### 3.` and `### 3a.` — do not collide. | Two headings resolve to the same identifier. | Renumber. |
| 8 | Zero matches for `embed(`, `cosineSimilarity`, `vectorSearch`, `relevanceScore`, or `rankScore` across `src/conductor/src`, `bin`, `hooks`, and `skills`, excluding any `engineer` directory. | Any harness-side embedding, vector-search, or relevance/rank-scoring logic exists for the memory subsystem. | Remove it. Recall is performed by the LLM reading the store, not by harness-side retrieval. |
| 9a | `VERSION` exists and matches `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$`. | Missing or malformed. | Fix `VERSION`. See [releases](releases.md). |
| 9b | `CHANGELOG.md` exists and contains a line matching `^## \[Unreleased\]`. | The file or the header is absent. Content may be empty. | Restore the header. |
| 9d | `skills/pipeline/SKILL.md` contains, case-insensitively, `user-requested exit during a run` **and** the literal `halt-user-input-required`. | Either string is gone. | Restore the contract text and keep the marker name in sync with `engine/artifacts.ts`. Without it, the build gate cannot distinguish a clean pipeline exit from an operator-requested halt. |
| 9e | `skills/stories/SKILL.md` matches `Status[^A-Za-z]*Accepted`. | The token is missing. | Restore the `Status: Accepted` instruction. The engineer land gate and the daemon backlog both require it; a stories file without it is skipped forever, silently. |
| 9f | `templates/adr.md.template`'s `**Status:**` line offers only pipe-delimited values whose leading word (uppercased) is `APPROVED` or `SUPERSEDED` — a terminal annotation like `SUPERSEDED by <slug>` stays valid. | Any offered status normalizes to something else, e.g. `Proposed` or `Accepted`. | Restore the template to offer only `APPROVED \| SUPERSEDED by {{superseding-adr-slug}}`. An offered value the `adrApprovalStatus` parser rejects would fail every new ADR at land and at daemon discovery. |
| 9g | `skills/architecture-review/SKILL.md` contains all four of `ai-conductor overlap-scan`, `Wiring Surface`, `advisory` (any case), and `/plan`. | Any one is missing. | Restore all four. |
| 9c | Every `git tag -l 'v*.*.*'` has a matching `^## \[<version>\]` section in `CHANGELOG.md`. Runs only when `.git` is a directory and `CHANGELOG.md` exists. | A released tag has no changelog section. | Add the section. |
| 10 | No write to `.pipeline/task-status.json` outside the engine. Greps `task-status` in `hooks/` and `bin/` (`*.sh`, `*.ts`, `*.js`), drops comment/console/log/`readFile` lines and quoted literals, then flags anything matching `writeFile`, `.write`, `fs.write`, `fs.appendFile`, `>>`, or `>`. | A non-engine writer is found. | Route the write through `src/conductor/src/engine/`. The engine is the sole authority on task-completion state. |
| — | `skills/pipeline/SKILL.md` does **not** match `(^\|[^\`])Run \`ai-conductor task (start\|done)`. | Imperative per-task CLI stamping text is present. | Rewrite descriptively — the skill documents session-hook machinery, not an imperative step. Mentions of the CLI as operator or recovery machinery are fine. |
| — | `skills/pipeline/SKILL.md` still states the batch-boundary evaluator closeout-event gate as a full semantic contract, exercised against fixtures that each corrupt one clause: the required `pipeline_closeout` obligation match text, the "an event for another obligation does not satisfy this check" clause, the independent `review.json` hard-gate clause, the exact `Batch N blocked: missing recorded closeout event for evaluator` halt message, and the two "cannot cure" non-substitutability clauses. | Any corrupted-fixture case still reads as passing (the predicate degraded into a keyword-presence check), or the real file fails one of the seven clauses. | Restore the exact clause the diagnostic names in `skills/pipeline/SKILL.md`; keep both the `review.json` gate and the evaluator closeout-event gate independently stated so neither can cure the other. |
| 11 | Every `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml` and `*.yaml` parses as YAML, and `config.yml`'s `blank_issues_enabled` is not `false`. Parses with python3 + pyyaml, falling back to node + js-yaml; WARN-skips when neither is available. | A template is invalid YAML, or `blank_issues_enabled: false` is set. | Fix the YAML. Leave `blank_issues_enabled` unset or true. |
| — | Every `.docs/intake/*.md` matches `^Owner:[[:space:]]*[^[:space:]]+`. | A hand-authored intake doc lacks an `Owner:` line. | Stamp `Owner:`. Authoring normally does this at write time; this is a belt on hand-written docs. |
| 12 | `skills/plan/SKILL.md` contains `ai-conductor overlap-scan` and, case-insensitively, `advisory`. | Either is missing. | Restore the overlap-scan step and its advisory wording. |
| 13 | `bash test/test_ci_detect_docs_only.sh` exits 0. | The docs-only CI predicate in `.github/scripts/ci-detect-docs-only.sh` regressed. | Fix the predicate; the failing assertions are printed inline. |
| 14 | `bash test/test_provider_skill_contracts.sh` exits 0. | An unscoped Claude-specific command, model, tool, delegation, or interaction — or a weakened shared gate — was reintroduced into a canonical skill. | Rescope the skill text so both hosts can load it. See [multiprovider](../guides/multiprovider.md). |
| 15 | `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` is a regular file, and both `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are symlinks whose `readlink` is exactly `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. | Either symlink is missing, replaced by a regular file, or retargeted. | `ln -sf AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md CLAUDE.md` and `ln -sf AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md AGENTS.md`. |
| 16 | `test/check_halt_writers.sh` — a lexical scan of `src/conductor/src` for production code that writes `.pipeline/HALT` (directly, via a local alias, or across a multiline call) outside `engine/halt-marker.ts`, plus its own fixture suite covering constant, multiline, alias-variable, and literal-path violations. | The script exits non-zero: a real violation is found, or a fixture the scanner is supposed to catch is missed. | Route the write through `writeHaltMarker` in `src/conductor/src/engine/halt-marker.ts` instead of writing the file directly. |
| 17 | `test/test_docs_navigation.sh --site-contract` (fixture and real-tree hosted-documentation navigation contracts) and `test/test_docs_pages_smoke.sh` (deterministic Pages adapter contracts, `gh` and `curl` replaced at the process boundary). | Either script exits non-zero, or either script is missing. | Fix the reported navigation or adapter contract violation. The real Pages HTTP probe is a separate opt-in smoke test, never run from integrity. |
| 19 | `test/check_migration_block_authoring.sh CHANGELOG.md`, plus fixtures in `test/test_migration_block_authoring.sh`. Every runnable migration block must be inside a `## [x.y.z]` release entry, use `${HARNESS_DIR}/bin` rather than `./bin`, avoid forced worktree/branch removal, and leave daemon lifecycle to the operator. | A block is unattributable, invokes `./bin`, force-removes a worktree or branch, or starts/stops/restarts a daemon (including a kill command). Diagnostics name the source line and clause. | Move the block into its release entry; resolve harness binaries through `${HARNESS_DIR}`; remove destructive Git or daemon lifecycle actions and print operator guidance instead. |
| 20 | The `/stories` skill's heading template parses under the engine's own grammar: `splitStoryBlocks` (`src/conductor/src/engine/story-criteria.ts`) still declares `/^##\s+Story\s+([A-Za-z0-9.\-]+)/i`; every `## Story` heading in `skills/stories/SKILL.md` carries an id; and the skill states the id requirement in prose. | The engine regex changes without the template, a template heading omits its id (`## Story: Title`), or the prose requirement is dropped. | Update `skills/stories/SKILL.md` and this check together. An id-less heading does not match, so a stories file collapses into one unnamed block: the per-story happy/negative gate then runs once over the whole file, per-story plan coverage falls back to a filename-derived id, and `story-<id>` coherence citations are rejected as fabricated at land. |

| 21 | Removed wiring-contract residue. `land-spec.ts` no longer calls `validateWiredIntoPlan`; `skills/plan/SKILL.md` contains no `Wired-into` or `validate-wired-into` guidance; and `skills/architecture-review/SKILL.md` cites the BUILD-time wiring-judgement ADR while stating that its SHIP sweep is unchanged. | A retired validator call or authoring reference returns, the architecture-review ADR citation is removed, or the unchanged SHIP sweep statement drifts. | Remove the retired residue. Keep wiring judgement in `build_review` and preserve architecture review's independent SHIP sweep. |

| 22 | Update-flow configuration ownership, plus the fixtures that keep the check honest. `test/check_update_flow_config_ownership.sh` extracts the allowed `conductor` keys from `validateConductorBlock`, then verifies the legacy JSON path appears under `bin/` only in `bin/lib/harness-common.sh`, and that direct keys, accessor-map outputs, and static accessor fields are schema-allowed. `test/test_harness_integrity_update_flow.sh` then drives that checker against disposable copies through its two seams (`HARNESS_INTEGRITY_UPDATE_FLOW_BIN_DIR`, `HARNESS_INTEGRITY_CONDUCTOR_SCHEMA_FILE`), proving it still rejects an injected legacy path, an unknown schema key, and an undeterminable allowlist. The spec calls the checker directly, never this suite, so nothing recurses. | The schema allowlist cannot be determined, the legacy path appears elsewhere under `bin/`, an update-flow key is not in the schema, a scan cannot run, or a fixture case stops failing. Diagnostics identify the offending file and line. | Keep the legacy JSON only as the one-time seed in `bin/lib/harness-common.sh`; route update state through `conductor:` and add any new key to `validateConductorBlock` before using it. If a fixture case stops failing, the guard has degraded — repair the checker, never the fixture. Scans use `grep`, whose exit codes separate "no matches" from "the scan failed"; a scan error fails closed, so an absent scanner can no longer read as a clean tree. |
| 24 | `test/check_build_review_rubric_skill_vocabularies.sh` executes the engine's anchor parser: a probe imports `build-review-domain.ts`, reads the exported `BUILD_REVIEW_FINDING_VOCABULARIES`, and classifies each anchor reference field's grammar by which discriminating specimens `parseBuildReviewFindingAnchor` accepts. Both are compared in both directions against each `skills/build-review-*/SKILL.md` declaration. | A vocabulary member or enforced grammar drifts from the contract in either direction, a field accepts arbitrary input (unenforced), acceptance matches no known grammar, the parser rejects the fully-documented specimen anchor, or the domain source cannot be read or executed. | Update the engine and the matching skill contract in the same change; if the parser grew a new required anchor field, update the probe's specimen anchors together with the contract. |
| 26 | The root `LICENSE` exactly matches the canonical Apache License 2.0 text; `NOTICE` carries project attribution; both package manifests and their lockfiles declare the `Apache-2.0` SPDX identifier; and README plus CONTRIBUTING document the grant. | A legal file is absent or altered, attribution drifts, package metadata disagrees, or the reader/contributor notice disappears. | Restore the canonical `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, package and lockfile metadata, README license section, and CONTRIBUTING license terms together. |

Note the ordering: the release-artifact sub-checks run `9a, 9b, 9d, 9e, 9f, 9g, 9c` — `9c` is last,
not third. Four checks carry no number at all.

`AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (and therefore `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`, which symlink to it) spells out only
the first seven checks in detail and names this page as the canonical enumeration.

## Checks that cannot fail

> **Known limitation.** Check 5 uses `warn_check`, so it can never fail the suite or change its exit
> code — it is reported as validation in prose but implemented as advisory. (Check 4 was advisory for
> the same reason until it was made fail-closed behind an allowlist; check 5 has no equivalent fix
> yet.) Check 5 also has a permanent WARN that no edit will clear: the `tdd` skill directory has no model-table row of its own
> because `HARNESS.md:186-187` lists `tdd-red` and `tdd-green`, and the check's regex `\| tdd[ (|]` does
> not match `| tdd-red`. Expect `tdd — not in ARCHITECTURE.md model selection table` in every run.
> Tracked in [#1014](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1014).

> **Known limitation.** Check 5b enforces one direction only. `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` describes it as
> "Every skill marked opus-tier in the model table pins `model: opus` in its SKILL.md frontmatter, and
> vice versa", but the implementation skips any skill with no `model:` line (`if [ -z "$pinned" ]; then
> continue; fi`). A skill the table marks opus-tier while its SKILL.md carries no pin passes silently —
> only the pin-to-expected direction is enforced, never expected-to-pin. Tracked in
> [#1014](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1014).

> **Known limitation.** Check 10's own comments say the audit covers "hooks, skills, or bin/" and would
> go red on unauthorized writers in `hooks/`, `skills/`, or `bin/`. The grep covers only
> `${HARNESS_DIR}/hooks` and `${HARNESS_DIR}/bin` — `skills/` is never scanned. A skill that instructs an
> agent to write `.pipeline/task-status.json` will not be caught here. Tracked in
> [#1014](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1014).

## Environment-dependent behavior

> **Known limitation.** Checks 5a, 5b, and 5c degrade to WARN-skip when `src/conductor/node_modules` is
> absent, and 5b also skips when `jq` is missing. In a fresh clone the run reports green while three
> generated-artifact drift gates never executed — and CI, which runs `npm ci` first, will catch the drift
> you did not. Run `cd src/conductor && npm ci` before treating a local integrity pass as meaningful.
> Tracked in [#1014](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1014).

> **Known limitation.** Check 1b degrades to WARN-skip when `shellcheck` is not on `PATH`, with the line
> `shellcheck not installed — skipping shell static analysis`. Same shape as the 5a/5b/5c gap above: the
> run reports green while the shell static-analysis gate never executed. CI installs the tool explicitly
> in both the `integrity` and `shellcheck` jobs, so it always enforces there. Locally, install it
> (`sudo apt-get install shellcheck`, `brew install shellcheck`) before treating a pass as meaningful.

> **Known limitation.** Check 5c mutates a tracked file during the run. It backs up
> `hooks/claude/docs-guard.sh` to a temp file, appends
> `# deliberately corrupted for drift-detection fixture test` to the committed path in place, runs
> `--check` expecting exit 1, then restores byte-for-byte — via a `trap` so a failed assertion still
> restores. If the process is hard-killed mid-check, your working tree is left with a corrupted committed
> hook. Recover with `git checkout -- hooks/claude/docs-guard.sh`. Tracked in
> [#1014](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1014).

## Where else the suite runs

| Context | Invocation |
| --- | --- |
| CI | The `integrity` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `bash test/test_harness_integrity.sh`. It is skipped when the `changes` job classifies the diff as docs-only. |
| CI (shell only) | The `shellcheck` job runs `bash test/lint_shell.sh` — the same script check 1b calls, so the two enforce one file set at one severity. Also skipped on docs-only diffs. |
| Self-host finish gate | `runIntegritySuite` in `src/conductor/src/engine/self-host/release-gate.ts` runs the same script with a 120-second budget before a PR opens. A missing script, a timeout, or any non-zero exit HALTs the build. See [releases](releases.md). |

Other static checks are separate from this suite: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run typecheck:test`,
`npm run lint`, and `npm test` in `src/conductor`, plus the `links` job's documentation link check.
See [testing](testing.md).
