# Skills

The catalog of all 36 skills: 31 under `skills/` and 5 repository-local ones under `.agents/skills/`.
For each, the frontmatter, the engine step that invokes it, what it reads, what it writes, and whether
it blocks.

A skill is a `SKILL.md` directory. The engine dispatches most of them by name at a
[step](steps.md); the rest are invoked by an operator, by another skill, or not wired at all. The two
plugins in this repository (`json-stdout-subscriber`, `recorder-provider`) define **zero** skills —
they are a UI renderer and an LLM provider respectively.

Skills are grouped by their declared `phase` and, within a group, listed in flow order. The text under
each skill name is its verbatim `description` frontmatter value — that string is what a host agent
matches on when deciding to invoke the skill.

## Frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | yes | Skill identifier; must match the directory name |
| `description` | yes | Model-facing trigger text — when to invoke this skill |
| `enforcement` | yes for `skills/*` | Declared strictness: `advisory`, `gating`, or `structural`. **Advisory only.** The engine's step definition decides real skippability — see [Known limitations](#known-limitations) |
| `phase` | yes for `skills/*` | `understand`, `decide`, `build`, `ship`, or `all` |
| `standalone` | no | Whether an operator can run the skill on its own. Absent means non-standalone |
| `operator_only` | no | `true` marks a skill an operator invokes from *outside* a run. `bin/install` still symlinks it into both user-space catalogs (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`), so the operator has it on either provider; the engine suppresses it per dispatch instead. Enforced — integrity check 5d fails on drift between this flag and `OPERATOR_ONLY_SKILLS` in `worktree-prepare.ts`. See [operator-only suppression coverage](#operator-only-suppression-coverage) for what each provider actually enforces |
| `phase_active_policy` | no | Operator-skill policy for `.pipeline/phase-active`. `daemon-triage` declares `advisory`: marker and daemon-status evidence may warn but never block read-only diagnosis |
| `disable-model-invocation` | invocation-dependent | Claude control. `true` keeps the skill operator/engine-invocable but removes it from model-initiated selection |
| `implicit_invocation` | invocation-dependent | Harness audit marker. `required` is allowed only for a verified same-session dependency that must remain model-invocable; it is not a host setting |
| `requires` | no | Prerequisite skills or artifact paths |
| `model` | no | Hand-authored model pin. Seven skills carry one; the rest inherit. See [models](models.md) |

## Invocation policy

Discovery is not activation. Every catalog entry is classified exhaustively by integrity check 2a:

- **Explicit-only:** Claude declares `disable-model-invocation: true`; Codex declares
  `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`. An operator or engine-rendered
  `/skill-name` or `$skill-name` prompt still works.
- **Implicit-required:** the shared frontmatter carries `implicit_invocation: required`, and neither
  host disable is present. This exception is reserved for a verified model-initiated caller inside an
  already active skill.

The 13 implicit-required shipped skills are:

| Skill group | Skills | Why they cannot be explicit-only in the distributed catalog |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/engineer` DECIDE composition | `explore`, `prd`, `architecture-diagram`, `architecture-review`, `stories`, `conflict-check`, `plan`, `coherence-check` | `/engineer` must run the real workflows directly in its current chat; it does not launch a second CLI session for them |
| Other same-session handoffs | `intake`, `debugging`, `simplify`, `verify-claims`, `code-removal` | Called from an active skill: issue authoring, fresh debugging, batch simplification, load-bearing claim verification, or removal-shaped build work — `/pipeline` dispatches `/code-removal` in place of a RED cycle |

The 18 explicit-only shipped skills are `assess`, `bootstrap`, `build-review-test-quality`, `code-review`, `conduct`,
`daemon-triage`, `engineer`, `finish`, `manual-test`, `memory`, `pipeline`, `prd-audit`, `rebase`,
`remediate`, `retro`, `pr`, `tdd`, and `writing-system-tests`. The five repository-local skills are also
explicit-only: `event-spine`, `maintain-documentation`, `release-disposition`, `scope-check`, and
`write-tests`.

`code-review` is intentionally explicit-only: pipeline embeds its three-stage evaluator contract and
states that no separate `code-review` dispatch is needed. `pr` is likewise explicit-only because
FINISH inlines its authoring contract and explicitly forbids delegating to `/pr`. Engine registry
invocations are explicit prompts, including conditional `remediate` and `rebase` steps, so those
skills do not need model discovery. A user may locally force any implicit-required skill to
explicit-only, but composed callers that depend on it will no longer complete automatically.

### Operator-only suppression coverage

`operator_only: true` is enforced per dispatch, not at install time — the operator keeps the skill on
both providers. Catalog invocation policy now provides the same baseline on both hosts:

| | Claude | Codex |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Self-host build** | Catalog `disable-model-invocation`, plus `skillOverrides` defense in depth | Catalog `allow_implicit_invocation: false`, plus pruning from the throwaway `CODEX_HOME` defense in depth |
| **Any other repo** | Catalog `disable-model-invocation` | Catalog `allow_implicit_invocation: false` |

`daemon-triage` therefore remains available when an operator explicitly asks for it without being a
model-selected response to an unrelated failure. Its phase-marker/liveness warning and per-mutation
approval contract remain necessary for explicitly initiated triage.

The repository integrity suite checks that every `skills/*/SKILL.md` has `name`, `description`,
`enforcement`, and `phase`. The five `.agents/skills/` entries are outside that required-field check;
they declare `name`, `description`, and the Claude invocation control. Check 2a covers invocation
policy across both catalogs and both host metadata formats.

Gate roles: **Blocking** means a non-passing result stops progression. **Advisory** means it runs and
records but never blocks. **Neither** means it has no gate role in the flow.

## Cross-cutting skills

### conduct

> Use to guide a feature through the full SDLC. Checks artifact state, determines current phase, tells you what to run next, and blocks progression when gates aren't met.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: all`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — not a step itself. The engine dispatches it with an argument for two steps:
  `/conduct worktree` (index 0, structural) and `/conduct complexity` (index 3, advisory).
- **Inputs** — artifact-existence checks across `CLAUDE.md`, `.memory/index.md`, and the `.docs/`
  subdirectories; `.pipeline/conduct-state.json` and the SHIP-tail evidence files; a grep of
  `.docs/decisions/adr-*.md` for `Status: DRAFT`.
- **Outputs** — `.pipeline/conduct-state.json` (`complexity_tier`, per-step status, `feature_status`);
  a clean-pass marker under `.docs/conflicts/`. Neither of its two steps has a completion glob.
- **Gate role** — the gate host. It directs; it does not run other skills.

### verify-claims

> Use whenever a statement, theory, or assumption is about to become load-bearing for a spec, plan, ADR, or code. Attaches grounded confidence estimates to claims, always surfaces assumptions, and HARD-BLOCKS work built on unconfirmed assumptions until the operator approves them.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: all`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — none. It is a discipline applied inside the calling skill's context and model, not
  a separately dispatched agent. Fifteen skills declare it in `requires`.
- **Inputs** — whatever the calling skill's load-bearing output is. One cheap read or grep is preferred
  over an estimate whenever it would settle the question.
- **Outputs** — `.pipeline/verify-claims-<step>.md` when invoked inside an engine step, otherwise
  inline in the artifact or response. On an autonomous block it writes `.pipeline/HALT` with the
  assumption ledger as its body.
- **Gate role** — blocking. Verdict `CLEAR` proceeds; `ASSUMPTIONS_PENDING` blocks. Interactive runs
  wait for operator approval; autonomous runs HALT and never guess a likely value.

### daemon-triage

> Use when a feature is stuck in daemon execution — halted, spinning, stalled, or silently not progressing — and an operator needs to know why. Diagnoses the failure and routes it to the right runbook. Operator-invoked only; never auto-dispatched, and never mutates anything without explicit per-action approval.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: advisory`, `phase: all`, `standalone: true`, `operator_only: true`,
  `phase_active_policy: advisory`, `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — none, by design. It is never dispatched. `operator_only: true` suppresses it for
  step sessions where the provider supports suppression (see [Frontmatter fields](#frontmatter-fields)).
  The skill treats `.pipeline/phase-active` and daemon status as advisory context: an apparently live
  step produces a warning, while read-only triage always continues. Recovery mutations remain
  individually operator-approved.
- **Inputs** — read-only evidence only: `conduct-ts daemon status`, `.daemon/daemon.log`, and the
  feature's `.pipeline/` state (`HALT` + `HALT.class`, `events.jsonl`, `task-status.json`,
  `step-heartbeat`, `phase-active`, `gates/<step>.json`), plus the branch's commit log.
- **Outputs** — a triage report at `.daemon/triage/<slug>-<timestamp>.md`. Deliberately **not** under
  `.pipeline/` — triage output is not feature evidence and must never be read as such by a gate.
- **Gate role** — none. Diagnosis is unconditionally read-only; gathering evidence never changes the
  state being measured. It may then carry out recovery, but **every** mutation — clearing a halt,
  park/unpark, editing `.pipeline/`, any writing git command — is presented with its blast radius and
  individually approved by the operator first. Approval is per-action and never standing consent, and
  it never relaxes the safety rails (an approved delete is still enumerated explicitly). Deliberately
  conservative while classification accuracy is being established.
- **Runbooks** — reached via `skills/daemon-triage/runbooks`, a symlink to `docs/runbooks/`. The
  symlink is what makes the reference resolve correctly in a consumer repo, where the harness's
  `docs/` tree is not present but the skill directory itself is symlinked in by `bin/install`.

### architecture-diagram

> Generate and maintain C4 architecture diagrams using Mermaid in Markdown. Runs at bootstrap, plan, and post-implementation. Gating — diagrams must reflect current architecture.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: all`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, `model: sonnet`.
- **Engine step** — `architecture_diagram` (index 5, DECIDE, skipped at tier S). Engine enforcement is
  `advisory`.
- **Inputs** — codebase structure (Procfile, `docker-compose.yml`, `database.yml`, routes, model
  definitions); the plan and stories on the update path; the `mermaid_renderer` config key.
- **Outputs** — `.docs/architecture/system-context.md`, `containers.md`, `components.md`, `erd.md`, and
  `sequences/<flow-name>.md`.
- **Gate role** — advisory as a step. Real enforcement is at land time: the spec-PR gate re-renders
  every authored Mermaid block and rejects the spec fail-closed if any block fails to render, or if
  diagrams exist but the renderer is unavailable.

## UNDERSTAND-phase skills

### bootstrap

> Use when starting a new project, onboarding to an existing project, or setting up the harness for the first time. Detects project type, tech stack, and generates project-specific configuration.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: advisory`, `phase: understand`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `bootstrap` (out-of-band, UNDERSTAND). Runs in the prelude before the loop.
- **Inputs** — root indicator files (`Gemfile`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`,
  `go.mod`, `database.yml`, `.rspec`, `Procfile`); `tech-context/<stack>/`; existing `CLAUDE.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `.claudeignore`, and `.claude/settings.json`, which it preserves rather than overwrites;
  `gh` and `git` history.
- **Outputs** — `bootstrap_mode` in `.pipeline/conduct-state.json`; env boundary files; `.claudeignore`;
  a PR template; `.claude/settings.json`; the `.pipeline/`, `.worktrees/`, and `.docs/` directory tree;
  DRAFT as-built stories; observed ADRs; a `.memory/` seed; initial architecture diagrams and a
  styleguide; a registry entry. No completion glob.
- **Gate role** — advisory, but downstream skills depend on the directory structure it creates.
  Failures are surfaced and not silently swallowed: a rejected first push must never be forced.

### memory

> Use when the operator requests project recall, when the harness dispatches its memory step, or when an active harness workflow requires a memory checkpoint. Recall-before-act protocol with categorized persistence and staleness detection.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: understand`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `memory` (index 1, UNDERSTAND). Engine enforcement is `advisory`.
- **Inputs** — `.memory/index.md`; entries under `.memory/decisions/`, `patterns/`, `gotchas/`, and
  `context/`, read in full; referenced file paths, checked for drift.
- **Outputs** — kebab-case Markdown entries under `.memory/`, each with `created`, `category`, and
  `related` frontmatter; an updated `.memory/index.md`. No `.docs/` or `.pipeline/` artifact.
- **Gate role** — advisory. Its two in-skill rules (recall at invocation start, persist decisions at
  declared checkpoints) produce no verdict, no marker file, and block nothing downstream.

### assess

> Use for codebase health assessment. Dispatches 9 specialist agents + CTO orchestrator to evaluate security, data integrity, dependencies, architecture, duplication, testing, infrastructure, observability, and developer experience.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: understand`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, `model: sonnet`.
- **Engine step** — `assess` (out-of-band, UNDERSTAND prelude). Auto-skipped with a `mode_skip` event
  when `bootstrap_mode` is `new`.
- **Inputs** — a full file listing; session-loaded tech-context; existing ADRs under `.docs/decisions/`
  for cross-reference and stale-ADR checks.
- **Outputs** — nine specialist reports under `.pipeline/assessment/`; the committed
  `.docs/decisions/technical-assessment-<date>.md`; the `assess`, `assess_date`, and `assess_verdict`
  state keys.
- **Gate role** — advisory. A `CRITICAL` verdict implies addressing findings before feature work but
  blocks nothing; findings become backlog.

## DECIDE-phase skills

### explore

> Use at the start of any new feature or change. Explores context, asks clarifying questions one at a time, proposes 2-3 approaches with trade-offs, and decides the work track (product vs technical). Divergent half of the old brainstorm — produces no committed design doc; the product-track PRD is authored by /prd.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: advisory`, `phase: decide`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `explore` (index 2, DECIDE). Always runs — it sets the track that gates `prd` and
  `prd_audit`.
- **Inputs** — `.memory/`; existing `.docs/stories/`; prior bootstrap exploration. At most two
  directory-partitioned exploration agents.
- **Outputs** — exactly one committed artifact, `.docs/track/<slug>.md`, carrying
  `Track: product|technical` and `Scope boundary: <operator-confirmed breadth and exclusions>`;
  ephemeral notes under `.pipeline/`; the selected approach and rejected alternatives promoted to
  `.memory/decisions/`. No completion glob, by design.
- **Gate role** — advisory, with four internal hard blocks: any unconfirmed assumption that would
  change the approach or track HALTs an autonomous run; the track must be operator-confirmed; the
  skill must ask the operator how comprehensive the fix should be and stop before approach
  confirmation if unanswered — it never defaults silently to minimal, balanced, or comprehensive
  scope; and the skill must never call `ExitPlanMode`, which would mark the step failed.

### prd

> Use on the PRODUCT track after /explore, when a feature has user-facing requirements. Authors a product-only design doc (PRD) with enumerated functional requirements. Convergent half of the old brainstorm. Skipped on the technical track (no product requirements to spec).

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: decide`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `prd` (index 4, DECIDE, prerequisite `explore`). Skipped on the technical track;
  a kickback target.
- **Inputs** — the `explore` track output, the design-doc and API-contract templates, and the original
  request.
- **Outputs** — `.docs/specs/<date>-<topic>.md`; a superseded prior doc renamed with a `SUPERSEDED-`
  prefix; an API response contract for API projects. It writes no files outside `.docs/specs/`.
- **Gate role** — blocking. A product-only audit runs before the PRD is presented: a PRD that names a
  new internal mechanism has failed and must be rewritten. Requires explicit operator approval.

### architecture-review

> Use before implementation to review stories through a technical feasibility and architectural alignment lens. Also use at batch boundaries to catch architectural drift.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: decide`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — two: `architecture_review` (index 6, DECIDE, engine enforcement `advisory`) and
  `architecture_review_as_built` (index 18, SHIP, engine enforcement `gating`), the latter invoked as
  `/architecture-review --as-built`. Both skip at tier S.
- **Inputs** — `.docs/decisions/`, `.docs/architecture/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.memory/decisions/`, existing
  code, and the PRD's FRs or the explore output. As-built mode reads only `Status: APPROVED` ADRs plus
  the feature diff.
- **Outputs** — `.docs/decisions/architecture-review-<date>-<feature>.md`; ADRs under
  `.docs/decisions/`; `.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md`, which must be rewritten on every
  invocation or the engine reads it as stale and halts the SHIP tail.
- **Gate role** — the as-built half is blocking and fail-closed: only `APPROVED` or `APPROVED WITH
  DRIFT NOTES` passes. The DECIDE half is advisory at the step level; its DRAFT-ADR hard gate is
  enforced by the `conduct` state machine and by the land-time spec gate instead. The as-built
  half's production reachability sweep derives root-to-caller-to-export chains from current shipped
  source, never from plan-declared callers.

### stories

> Use after architecture-review, when the design is approved. Generates user stories with mandatory happy and negative paths as Given/When/Then scenarios — from the PRD's FRs (product track) or the technical intent (technical track).

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: decide`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `stories` (index 7, DECIDE, prerequisite `architecture_review`). A kickback target;
  no tier skip.
- **Inputs** — approved PRD FRs, or technical intent plus approved ADRs; existing `.docs/stories/` for
  deduplication and DRAFT completion; tech-context; `.memory/`.
- **Outputs** — `.docs/stories/<feature-name>.md`, one file per feature area, appended if it exists.
- **Gate role** — blocking. No story is accepted without at least one concrete negative path per
  acceptance criterion. The verdict layer additionally requires `### Happy Path` and
  `### Negative Path(s)` sections with Given/When/Then bullets and no `Status: DRAFT`. The status marker
  is also a downstream hard gate: the land gate rejects stories lacking `Status: Accepted`.

### conflict-check

> Use after writing stories, before creating an implementation plan, or when adding features to an existing system. Detects contradictions, overlaps, state conflicts, resource contention, and oscillating requirements that are individually satisfiable but mutually exclusive in practice — the pair that sends work round a kickback loop that never terminates.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: decide`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `conflict_check` (index 8, DECIDE, prerequisite `stories`, skipped at tier S).
- **Inputs** — all `.docs/stories/*.md`; active `.docs/specs/`; prior `.docs/conflicts/` reports; and
  approved ADRs. `conflict_check.adr_corpus` defaults to `change_set`; `repo_wide` narrows all approved
  ADRs to the stories' subject and records the ADRs examined and narrowed out.
- **Outputs** — `.docs/conflicts/<date>-<description>.md`, overwritten on re-run; in-place edits to
  affected story files; superseding ADRs. An ADR-versus-story conflict quotes both opposing sentences
  verbatim; multi-sentence excerpts use `[…]` for every omitted span.
- **Gate role** — blocking. It loops until zero blocking conflicts remain. Kickback routing is by root
  cause: contradictory FRs go to `prd`, incompatible design goes to `architecture_review`, pure phrasing
  is resolved in `stories`. In an unattended run a blocking conflict HALTs for a human — never a silent
  pass.

### plan

> Use after stories are written and conflict-check has passed clean. Converts user stories into a step-by-step implementation plan with 2-5 minute task granularity.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: decide`, `standalone: false`,
  `requires: [".docs/stories/ with both paths", ".docs/conflicts/ clean pass or no blocking conflicts", verify-claims]`,
  no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `plan` (index 9, DECIDE, prerequisite `conflict_check`). A kickback target; no tier
  skip.
- **Inputs** — all `.docs/stories/`; the clean conflict-check pass; the architecture review's
  `## Wiring Surface` section at tiers M and L.
- **Outputs** — `.docs/plans/<date>-<feature>.md`.
- **Gate role** — blocking. It refuses to produce a plan without stories, dependency lines, both paths,
  and a clean conflict-check; every acceptance criterion must map to at least one task; 41 or more tasks
  is a hard stop. Every task carries a `Done when:` block with two to five nonblank, falsifiable
  completion checks. At land time, a missing, empty, underspecified, or oversized block rejects the
  whole spec; Markdown fenced-code examples do not count as task structure or checks. An unbounded
  quality word ("fail-closed", "robust", "comprehensive") must be closed by an enumeration or a named
  mechanism in the same block, and completion review is bound by these checks (deeper concerns are
  filed as intake, not raised as blocking findings). Each `Story:`
  line takes one id — a comma-separated list silently registers only the first. Plans must not append
  a terminal catch-all task that re-proves the completed feature; scoped tests stay with their
  behavior-owning implementation task, while writing-system-tests and later BUILD/SHIP gates own
  whole-feature validation.
- **Declared pattern replication** — a plan may add `**Pattern-source:**` and `**Rename-map:**` header
  lines to declare that it replicates an existing source file under a rename map, so BUILD copies and
  verifies that source mechanically instead of deriving it from scratch. Both lines are required
  together; either line alone, an unresolvable source path, or a malformed rename-map pair is
  `malformed` and fails closed, distinct from the no-declaration `absent` case. See [gates](../explanation/gates.md)
  for how `build_review` verifies the declared copy.

### coherence-check

> Use at the end of DECIDE (after /plan), for Medium and Large tier specs only, to author the committed traceability mapping — outcomes → FRs → stories → tasks with per-row verdicts — that the land-time coherence gate validates. Not used for S tier.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: decide`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `coherence_check` (index 10, DECIDE, prerequisite `plan`, skipped at tier S).
- **Inputs** — `.docs/complexity/` for the tier; staged outcomes or `.docs/intake/<plan-stem>.md`;
  `.docs/specs/<plan-stem>.md` for FRs; `.docs/stories/<plan-stem>.md`; `.docs/plans/<plan-stem>.md`;
  and accepted ADRs that constrain the stories.
- **Outputs** — `.docs/coherence/<plan-stem>.md`. The stem must match the plan filename stem exactly or
  the land validator rejects it as a missing coherence artifact. Applicable `adr` rows trace each
  accepted decision to the stories that implement or must honor it. The sixth row class, `criterion`,
  maps each exact extracted happy- or negative-path criterion to cited plan tasks in a six-cell row:
  criterion text, task ids, verdict, a verbatim task-body quote, and `diff-local` or `outside-diff`.
- **PRD ↔ stories tie-out** — the `fr` and `story` row classes are checked in both directions (SKILL.md
  §4e). Forward: no PRD `FR-N` without a citing story that a task covers. Reverse: no story citing an
  `FR-N` the PRD never declares, and no story citing no FR at all. Both directions are re-derived
  mechanically by the land-time gate from the real PRD and stories files, so the skill spends its judgement
  on whether a cited FR is actually *delivered* by that story's scenarios — a correct citation the
  acceptance criteria contradict is `fail`, not `covered`. Story-versus-story contradictions stay with
  `conflict-check`; this skill compares each story against the PRD.
- **Gate role** — blocking. It authors the artifact the land-time coherence gate validates. Verdicts are
  exactly `covered`, `gap`, or `fail` — `fail` marks a row whose counterpart exists but contradicts it,
  which coverage alone cannot express. Criterion rows enforce that vocabulary mechanically; unknown
  values are malformed. The five legacy row classes retain affirmative-by-default parsing for backward
  compatibility. In an autonomous run an ambiguous row is marked `gap` and left for the fail-closed land
  gate — never silently passed. At tier S it does not run and must not author a stub.

### intake

> Use when filing an intake issue to GitHub — capturing a bug, idea, or observation for a later DECIDE phase. Structures the issue as WHAT (observed evidence, impact) and desired OUTCOMES (observable acceptance signals), with verbatim logs/commands/repro artifacts a zero-context engineer can debug from. Never prescribes HOW — that belongs to DECIDE.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: decide`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — none. Operator- or agent-invoked, in whatever session observed the problem.
- **Inputs** — verbatim commands and output, log excerpts with source path and timestamp, `file:line`
  and SHA references, repro steps, frequency, and environment facts.
- **Outputs** — a GitHub issue. No repository file artifact.
- **Gate role** — neither. Its gate is a pre-file checklist at authoring time; nothing downstream blocks
  on it. See [intake](../guides/intake.md) for the filing procedure.

### engineer

> Interactive, phone-drivable idea→spec loop: hands a raw idea to the right repo, runs the full DECIDE phase there, and opens a spec PR. Use when capturing and routing new work, NOT when building inside one repo (that is plain conduct).

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: advisory`, `phase: decide`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`,
  `model: opus`.
- **Engine step** — none. It is a separate control plane with its own CLI subcommands.
- **Inputs** — a claimed GitHub intake issue, or a launch argument or chat idea; the project registry.
- **Outputs** - in a per-idea worktree on a `spec/<slug>` branch: the track marker and feature-scoped
  PRD, stories, complexity, conflict, plan, and coherence artifacts named with the exact slug
  returned by `engineer worktree`; the remaining DECIDE artifacts under their established naming
  contracts; an intake marker committed at land; the spec PR.
- **Gate role** — neither as an engine step, but the land gate is hard: no idea reaches a build without
  a merged spec PR, only the operator merges, no spec lands with a DRAFT ADR, and the tier must be
  recorded. Worktree creation owns the mechanical start, route, and worktree events. A no-hook host
  owns live authoring transitions through `engineer run-record`, using only accepted-result or
  deterministic-artifact evidence for completion; land owns final reconciliation and refusal.
  See [engineer-loop](../guides/engineer-loop.md).

## BUILD-phase skills

### writing-system-tests

> Use BEFORE implementing any feature that has stories in .docs/stories/ — generates failing acceptance specs from acceptance criteria as the RED phase of TDD. Generates HTTP/request-level acceptance tests for headless/API projects, end-to-end UI tests for projects with a frontend, using the project's own test framework and directory conventions.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: build`, `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
  It is the only `skills/*` entry with no `standalone` key, so it defaults to non-standalone.
- **Engine step** — `acceptance_specs` (index 11, BUILD, prerequisite `plan`, skipped at tier S).
- **Inputs** — happy and negative acceptance criteria from `.docs/stories/*.md`; the existing test suite
  and tech-context for framework and layout detection; the approved PRD FR list on the product track.
- **Outputs** — committed acceptance spec files in the project's test directories, plus gitignored run
  evidence: `.pipeline/acceptance-specs-red.json`, `.pipeline/fr-coverage.md`, and
  `.pipeline/acceptance-specs-run.json`.
- **Gate role** — blocking. The gate rejects unless the RED evidence shows at least one failure, zero
  skips, zero errors, and at least one executed spec. Any unresolved FR-coverage row is a hard stop
  under the daemon.
- **Declared pattern replication** — when the plan header resolves a `**Pattern-source:**` /
  `**Rename-map:**` declaration, the skill copies and renames the source feature's acceptance specs
  instead of deriving them. RED is still earned honestly: the copied specs fail because their target
  does not yet exist. An empty source spec set, a rename-map target-path collision, or an all-passing
  copied set all fail closed rather than falling back to derivation.

### pipeline

> Use when executing an implementation plan with multiple tasks. Factory orchestration with three autonomy levels, quality gates, rework budgets, and audit trails.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: structural`, `phase: build`, `standalone: false`,
  `requires: [".docs/plans/ with implementation plan"]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `build` (index 12, BUILD, prerequisite `plan`). Checkpoint, loop gate, structural,
  never tier-skipped, never disableable.
- **Inputs** — the plan's task dependency graph, file sets, and dependency lines;
  `.pipeline/task-status.json`; story acceptance criteria; prior batch reviews; ADRs and the approved
  PRD for the design-conformance check.
- **Outputs** — `.pipeline/audit-trail/batch-N/review.json` and the batch retro and simplification
  records; `.pipeline/progress.log`; `.pipeline/summary.json`; `.pipeline/halt-user-input-required` and
  `.pipeline/HALT` on a stall; at least one `.memory/` entry per batch; a `pipeline_closeout` record in
  `.pipeline/pipeline-events.jsonl` per completed evaluator gate, written via `conduct-ts
  closeout-event`. `.pipeline/current-task` and `.pipeline/task-status.json` are written by engine
  hooks and must not be hand-edited.
- **Gate role** — blocking. Evaluator dispatch at each batch boundary is mandatory; a missing or empty
  `review.json` halts and re-dispatches. A missing, malformed, or non-matching `evaluator`
  `pipeline_closeout` record is an independent second hard gate (waived for a batch already in flight
  before the closeout-event emitter shipped) — see [`conduct-ts closeout-event`](cli.md#conduct-ts-closeout-event).
  `BLOCK` halts and escalates; `REQUEST_CHANGES` triggers rework against a three-cycle budget. Two
  consecutive zero-completion attempts trip a circuit breaker.
- **Declared replication copy task** — on a plan with a resolved `**Pattern-source:**` /
  `**Rename-map:**` declaration, exactly one task is the mechanical, zero-LLM copy: it writes only the
  targets its `**Files:**` declaration lists, fails closed naming an undeclared target or an unreadable
  source, and leaves no partial copy on failure. A later task the copy commit fully satisfies — every
  acceptance criterion and its scoped verification — may close through the existing
  `Evidence: satisfied-by <sha>` form; a task only partly satisfied always runs the full, unmodified
  RED → DOMAIN → GREEN → DOMAIN → COMMIT cycle instead of being split.
- **Fan-out** — Standard and Full derive a ready frontier from completed dependencies and
  non-overlapping file sets, then launch up to three tasks in one provider-native concurrent
  dispatch and join before verification. Claude Code uses multiple Agent tool calls in one response;
  Codex uses multiple `collaboration.spawn_agent` calls in one response. Conservative, dependent
  tasks, and overlapping-file tasks stay sequential. A selected host without native fan-out stops
  with an actionable capability diagnostic instead of silently serializing Standard or Full.
- **Dispatches** — `agents/evaluator.md`, `agents/generator.md`, `agents/worktree-manager.md`.

### tdd

> Use when implementing any feature or bugfix. Five-step cycle: RED → DOMAIN → GREEN → DOMAIN → COMMIT. Enforces test-first development with domain integrity review at every phase boundary.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: structural`, `phase: build`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, no
  model pin.
- **Engine step** — none. It is the per-task cycle every `pipeline` implementer runs.
- **Inputs** — one acceptance criterion from the plan; test and source directory paths; the
  `steps.build.tdd.red.model` and `.green.model` config keys; tech-context lint and typecheck commands;
  `.memory/decisions/`.
- **Outputs** — git commits carrying `Task: <id>` trailers, including empty evidence commits;
  conditional `.memory/gotchas/` and `.memory/patterns/` entries. No `.docs/` artifact.
- **Gate role** — neither in flow terms, but COMMIT is a hard in-cycle gate: scoped tests green, linter
  and type-check clean, clean tree, and an exact bare plan task id in the trailer. The domain reviewer
  holds veto authority back to RED or GREEN. `Task:` trailers are telemetry only — build completion is
  derived by `build_review`, not from trailer self-reports.
- **Declared replication does not shorten the cycle** — a declared replication's copy task only
  establishes a baseline. A later task closes via `Evidence: satisfied-by <copy-sha>` only when the copy
  satisfies that task's whole scope; any task introducing behavior the source lacks, or only partly
  covered by the copy, runs the identical unmodified cycle. A first test that passes immediately on a
  delta task does not permit skipping to implementation.
- **Dispatches** — `agents/generator.md` (RED and GREEN), `agents/domain-reviewer.md` (both DOMAIN
  phases).

### code-removal

> Use when removing a file, seam, flag, symbol, or code path. Defines the evidence and test discipline for deletion-shaped work.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: advisory`, `phase: all`, no model pin. It is implicit-required:
  `/pipeline` activates it inside an already-running build session.
- **Engine step** — none. `plan` and `stories` route removal-shaped authoring to it, `tdd` defers
  its removal doctrine to it, and `/pipeline`'s DISPATCH step sends a removal-shaped task to it in
  place of opening a RED cycle.
- **Inputs** — the obsolete file, seam, flag, symbol, or code path; the behavior that must survive;
  and the source, test, configuration, and documentation references that mention it.
- **Outputs** — the deletion diff, any pre-deletion characterization tests needed to cover a
  non-obvious survivor, and a green full surviving suite.
- **Gate role** — advisory. It forbids absence tests: deletion evidence is the diff plus the green
  suite. It requires a survivor inventory for non-obvious survivors, triages touching tests as
  DIRECT or INCIDENTAL, and finishes with a literal reference sweep.

### code-review

> Use after implementing a task, before merging, or when requesting quality verification. Dispatches an evaluator agent with fresh context for calibrated, skeptical review.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: build`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, `model: opus`.
- **Engine step** — none. The pipeline evaluator satisfies this gate at batch boundaries. The engine's
  `build_review` step is a separate, engine-native grader, not this skill.
- **Inputs** — `git diff <batch-start-commit>..HEAD`, scoped to the batch rather than the full branch;
  the story and acceptance criterion; the plan task; affected-test results; the tech-context review
  checklist.
- **Outputs** — no committed artifact. The evaluator emits an in-band structured verdict, persisted to
  `.memory/patterns/` and `.memory/gotchas/` at the memory checkpoint.
- **Gate role** — blocking in place, with no kickback file: a `BLOCK` verdict prevents merge and
  `REQUEST_CHANGES` must be addressed before re-review.
- **Dispatches** — `agents/evaluator.md` in a fresh context, and `agents/domain-reviewer.md`.

### simplify

> Review changed code for duplication, complexity, and over-engineering at batch boundaries. Blocking gate — must pass before next batch proceeds.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: build`, `standalone: false`, `requires: []`,
  `model: sonnet`.
- **Engine step** — none. It runs inside `pipeline`'s post-batch checks and from `tdd`'s batch-boundary
  refactor rule.
- **Inputs** — the batch diff by name; the batch-start commit; existing tests at the same production
  seam; ADRs that justify an abstraction; linter output.
- **Outputs** — `.pipeline/audit-trail/batch-N-simplification.md`.
- **Gate role** — blocking within the batch. `CLEAN` proceeds; `SIMPLIFY_REQUIRED` must be fixed before
  the next batch and counts against pipeline's three-cycle rework budget.
- **Declared replication is informed, not silenced** — a declared replication's mapped source/target
  pair alone is not flagged as an extract-with-parameters finding. Undeclared duplication, and
  similarity outside the declared target set, is still flagged, and the skill retains authority to
  propose extraction on a declared pair when rationale beyond the replication itself merits it.

### debugging

> Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior. Four-phase systematic investigation: root cause before fix. No fixes without evidence.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: build`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, `model: opus`.
- **Engine step** — none. Invoked on demand, and by `manual-test` in a fresh sub-session when a failure's
  cause is not self-evident.
- **Inputs** — the full error and stack trace and logs; `.memory/gotchas/` and `.memory/patterns/`;
  recent git history; the governing `Status: APPROVED` ADR or the relevant FR.
- **Outputs** — a failing reproduction test and the fix; entries in `.memory/gotchas/` and
  `.memory/patterns/`. No `.docs/` or `.pipeline/` artifact.
- **Gate role** — neither in flow terms, with two hard in-skill rules: no fix proposals before the
  investigation completes, and a design-conformance stop — if the buggy path violates or is superseded
  by an approved decision, the output is a conformance finding, not a patch. Three failed fixes escalate
  to the operator.

`test-suite` and `wiring-check` have no `SKILL.md` — both `test_suite` (index 14) and `wiring_check`
(index 13) are **engine-native** BUILD steps. `test_suite` obtains a current result from the
repository-configured aggregate verifier. `wiring_check` is a deprecated no-op retained for compatibility.
`build_review` dispatches the engine-managed test-quality rubric
skills; their raw verdicts are joined before effective dispositions are applied. The two names remain in `build_verification` (see
[The build verification group](steps.md#the-build-verification-group)); it fans out after `build` and
joins before `build_review`.

## SHIP-phase skills

### manual-test

> Use after /finish to validate stories via curl (API) or browser (full-stack). Bugs found loop back through /tdd.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: ship`, `standalone: false`,
  `requires: [finish, verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `manual_test` (index 16, SHIP, prerequisite `test_suite`, skipped at tier S).
  Checkpoint and loop gate, and the only step that opts into `configDisableAllowed`.
- **Inputs** — story acceptance criteria; the running application; the absolute worktree `.pipeline`
  path supplied in the step's system prompt.
- **Outputs** — `.pipeline/manual-test-results.md`, written solely by `conduct-ts manual-test-record`,
  append-only as numbered attempt sections with per-criterion `PASS`, `WARN`, or `FAIL` results;
  `.pipeline/manual-test-fail-evidence.json`.
- **Gate role** — blocking. Only the latest attempt is evaluated. The skill must never hand-write or
  fabricate the results file — an absent marker is the correct refusal signal. A whitewash guard
  requires new commits after a recorded FAIL before a later FAIL-free attempt is accepted. Missing
  or unlaunchable browser automation dependencies are recorded as non-blocking `WARN` without
  installing them during SHIP; available API criteria continue through `curl`. An application
  mismatch observed after the browser launches remains a blocking `FAIL`.
- **This repository** — `manual_test` is disabled in `.ai-conductor/config.yml`. See
  [self-hosting](../guides/self-hosting.md).

### prd-audit

> Use at SHIP, after manual-test and before retro/finish. Audits the shipped implementation against the feature stories' acceptance criteria, using PRD functional requirements as intent context when a PRD exists; produces graded, criterion-level findings and never implements or routes work itself.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: ship`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, `model: opus`.
- **Engine step** — `prd_audit` (index 17, SHIP, prerequisite `manual_test`). Loop gate; runs on every
  feature, at every tier and on both tracks — the skill does not infer a skip from tier, track, or the
  absence of a PRD.
- **Inputs** — the feature's committed stories (the audit key) via the active plan's `**Stories:**`
  reference; the active plan and any coherence mapping; the matching non-`SUPERSEDED-` PRD when present
  (context, not the key); the implementation, changed tests, and BUILD `Scope:` trailers; operator
  reseal and `Scope:` trailer rationales as immutable `OVER_SCOPE` intent evidence.
- **Outputs** — `.pipeline/prd-audit.md`, overwritten each run; a code-stamp sidecar on the pass path.
- **Gate role** — blocking. Each finding carries exactly one grade — `PASS`, `FIXABLE`, `PLAN_GAP`, or
  `OVER_SCOPE` — and the report needs exactly one graded verdict row per acceptance criterion. A
  `FIXABLE` row must name its owning plan task. `FIXABLE` findings appends a bounded remediation lap
  (capped tasks, see [configuration](configuration.md#prd_audit)); exceeding the cap, needing a second
  lap, a happy-path `PLAN_GAP`, or a user-visible out-of-intent `OVER_SCOPE` halts for the operator.
  A negative-path or edge-scenario `PLAN_GAP`, and an `OVER_SCOPE` widening within intent or with no
  user-visible effect, are recorded in the verdict and the shipped record and the feature ships.
- **Dispatches** — `agents/prd-auditor.md`, one dispatch for the whole audit.

### remediate

> Use when a SHIP gate blocks — a prd-audit FIXABLE finding, the as-built architecture review's BLOCKED verdict, or finish verification — or on a build stall. Emits a per-gap disposition and concrete tasks routed to the owning step, and HALTs only for gaps that need a human.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: ship`, `standalone: true`,
  `requires: [verify-claims]`, no model pin.
- **Engine step** — `remediate` (out-of-band, SHIP, prerequisite `prd_audit`). Engine enforcement is
  `advisory`. Deliberately outside the sequential list so the loop never dispatches it unconditionally.
- **Inputs** — `.pipeline/prd-audit.md`, `.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md`,
  `.pipeline/test-failures.md`, and `.pipeline/build-stall-question.md`. A `build_review` FAIL no
  longer dispatches `/remediate`: it routes straight back to `build` with its own best-effort
  `plan contract:` and `prior attempts:` pointer lines (see
  [gates](../explanation/gates.md#where-a-build_review-fail-goes)).
- **Outputs** — `.pipeline/remediation.json`, overwritten each run. The engine then appends each task
  into the feature's plan. No completion glob — the engine reads the JSON directly to route.
- **Gate role** — advisory; it is the unblocker rather than a blocker. HALT is reserved for exactly
  three categories: architectural clarity, product scope, and unanswerable. Every other gap must route
  to `build`, `acceptance_specs`, `architecture_review`, or `plan`. On absent, stale, or malformed
  input the engine falls back to deterministic gap classification. The engine also HALTs, independent
  of category, when a `build` gap carries no concrete task outside a build-stall question — a taskless
  `build` disposition is not dispatchable work.
- **Dispatches** — `agents/remediation-planner.md`.

### retro

> Use after finishing a feature or at any natural milestone. Dual retrospective analyzing both the harness workflow (tool) and the application code produced (product). Generates concrete improvement proposals.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: advisory`, `phase: ship`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, no model
  pin.
- **Engine step** — `retro` (index 19, SHIP, prerequisite `architecture_review_as_built`, skipped at
  tier S). Loop gate.
- **Inputs** — `.pipeline/audit-trail/events.jsonl` as the primary gate and rework source, explicitly
  not `.pipeline/gates/`; `.pipeline/task-status.json`; raw `.pipeline/events.jsonl` for retry history;
  `.memory/gotchas/`; `.docs/conflicts/`; `.docs/stories/`; the feature diff; the `## Cost` block of the
  shipped record.
- **Outputs** — `.docs/retros/<date>-<feature-name>.md`; `.memory/` writes; new debt stories.
- **Gate role** — advisory. Two internal honesty rules: a missing or empty events log is reported as
  `INCOMPLETE`, never read as a clean run; a missing Cost block is written as `unmetered/absent`, never
  fabricated. The completion predicate requires a feature-slug-matched, session-fresh retro file.

### rebase

> Resolve an in-progress paused rebase conflict, stage fixes, and drive git rebase --continue to completion; invoked by the conductor's finish-time rebase step or by an operator running /rebase.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: advisory`, `phase: ship`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, no model
  pin.
- **Engine step** — `rebase` (index 20, SHIP, prerequisite `retro`). Engine enforcement is
  `structural`. The engine rebases natively and dispatches this skill **only on conflict**.
- **Inputs** — live git state only: status, the rebase-merge or rebase-apply path, the unmerged file
  list, and the conflicted files.
- **Outputs** — no file artifact. Its output *is* the contract: the last stdout JSON line, either
  `{"resolved": true}` or `{"resolved": false, "reason": "..."}`, parsed by the step runner.
- **Gate role** — blocking through the structural step. An unresolved result or an unsafe hunk retries
  up to a cap and then HALTs. Non-negotiable prohibitions: never `--abort`, never `--skip`, never
  `push --force`, never invoke mid-build.
- **Replay verification** — before editing, the skill captures the replay source commit's and
  upstream's intent as an evidence ledger, and HALTs at the first semantic ambiguity rather than
  guessing. Before `git rebase --continue`, it reviews the complete staged diff (not just the
  conflicted hunks) and requires every staged change to be attributable to the source or a
  necessary upstream adaptation. After `git rebase --continue`, it inspects the resulting replay
  commit against the retained pre-continue identity and validated intent, and only emits
  `{"resolved": true}` once every replay commit — including the final one — has reconciled.

### finish

> Author and then judge reader-facing PR prose at the engine-owned FINISH boundary after deterministic publication prerequisites pass.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: gating`, `phase: ship`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, no model
  pin.
- **Engine step** — `finish` (index 21, SHIP, prerequisite `rebase`). Loop gate, gating, no tier skip.
  The production coordinator dispatches this skill for exactly two bounded retained-PR title/body
  passes, and picks between them deterministically from its own observation of the PR body:
  `author_pr_prose` when the body is still the engine-seeded placeholder, `judge_pr_prose` for the
  quality verdict on prose that exists. The judgment pass is therefore never handed an unauthored body.
- **Inputs** — the retained PR identity plus its observed title and body. The authoring pass
  additionally reads the feature branch's full diff against its base and the feature's spec, plan, and
  story artifacts. Deterministic BUILD, SHIP, release-readiness, push, shipped-record, and outcome
  evidence stays engine-owned.
- **Outputs** — a rewritten reader-facing PR title/body (authoring), or an accepted verdict or bounded
  repair (judgment). Neither is trusted on self-report: the coordinator re-reads the PR and a body that
  still classifies as a placeholder is a failed pass. The coordinator separately persists
  `state.pr_url`, commits `.docs/shipped/<slug>.md`, and writes `.pipeline/finish-choice` through
  `conduct-ts finish-record` after verification.
- **Gate role** — blocking. Missing or invalid deterministic evidence stops before this skill is
  dispatched. A placeholder body routes back to authoring; halt boilerplate and a refused judgment
  require a human. No prose defect commits the shipped record, so the halt stays re-dispatchable.
- **Interaction** — attended default and interactive foreground conduct asks the operator for PR, keep,
  or defer before any publication observation or mutation. Explicit foreground-auto and daemon modes
  use engine policy. No FINISH transition has PR merge or auto-merge authority.

### pr

> Use when creating or updating a pull request. Analyzes the full diff against the base branch, writes a concise title and structured body, and creates or updates the PR via gh.

- **Frontmatter** — `enforcement: advisory`, `phase: ship`, `standalone: true`, `requires: []`, no model
  pin.
- **Engine step** — none. Operator-invoked. `finish` does **not** call it: the Push & PR path
  inlines the same title/body contract and pre-push checks so the finish turn survives to write
  its completion record.
- **Inputs** — the branch log and diff against the base; `.docs/specs/` and `.docs/stories/`;
  `.pipeline/conduct-state.json`; the project's PR-title conventions.
- **Outputs** — the GitHub PR title and body, a pushed branch, and the PR URL. No repository file
  artifact.
- **Gate role** — neither, with one internal rule: `finish` owns completion verification. If no current
  pass exists, this skill stops and routes back rather than running the aggregate command itself.

## Repository-local skills

These live under `.agents/skills/` rather than `skills/`, declare only `name` and `description`, and
apply to this repository. See [self-hosting](../guides/self-hosting.md).

### event-spine

> Use BEFORE designing any new way to observe, report, or coordinate something in the ai-conductor repository — a watcher, a poller, a sidecar file, an ad-hoc log, a second telemetry path, or a timestamp stamped into an artifact to be read back later. Also use when adding a member to the `ConductorEvent` union, introducing a new `.pipeline/*.jsonl` ledger, deciding whether something 'should be an event', or reaching for a channel outside the bus because the bus looks inconvenient. Decides whether the existing spine (`ConductorEventEmitter` → `ConductorEvent` → `EventPersister` → `.pipeline/events.jsonl`) already carries the concern, applies the schema-not-file test, and names the only three exceptions that justify a separate write. Invoke it even when the new mechanism looks small, obviously correct, or too minor to count as telemetry — a parallel channel is cheap to prevent at design time and near-impossible to remove once consumers depend on it.

- **Frontmatter** — `name` and `description` only. No `enforcement`, `phase`, `standalone`, `requires`,
  or `model`.
- **Engine step** — none. Invoked at design time, before an approach is written down. Symlinked from
  `.claude/skills/event-spine` so both supported hosts discover the same file.
- **Inputs** — the design under consideration, plus the spine itself: the `ConductorEvent` union in
  `src/conductor/src/types/events.ts`, `EventPersister`, and `.pipeline/events.jsonl`.
- **Outputs** — a four-line verdict (channel?, occurrence versus durable state, extend/sibling/new
  channel, and which exception applies). No repository file artifact.
- **Gate role** — neither. Advisory, with no marker file and no HALT. Its rule is stated as a Design
  Principle in `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, which points here and makes reading it mandatory before any
  such design; a genuinely new channel is escalated to an ADR rather than blocked by this skill.

### maintain-documentation

> Review and maintain this repository's human-facing documentation. Use when this repository invokes its maintain-documentation custom step or explicitly requests documentation maintenance.

- **Frontmatter** — `name` and `description` only. No `enforcement`, `phase`, `standalone`, `requires`,
  or `model`.
- **Engine step** — a custom step wired in `.ai-conductor/config.yml` with `after: rebase`,
  `enforcement: gating`, and `completion_artifact: .pipeline/maintain-documentation-pass`. It inherits
  `rebase`'s loop-gate flag, landing between `rebase` and `finish`.
- **Inputs** — the current implementation change plus repository evidence. Its authority rule: code,
  tests, generated help, schemas, and observed behavior outrank `.docs/`, which is context only.
- **Outputs** — `.pipeline/maintain-documentation-review.md`, overwritten at the start of every
  invocation; `.pipeline/maintain-documentation-pass`, written only after a PASS verdict; documentation
  and changelog commits. `.docs/` is read-only to it.
- **Gate role** — blocking. On `BLOCKED` the pass marker stays absent. Blocking conditions include
  unverifiable claims, unresolved contradictions in authoritative evidence, dangling-link removals, and
  changelog validation failures.

### release-disposition

> Judge this repository's implementation diff and write its authoritative structured release disposition to the retained SHIP draft PR before finish.

- **Frontmatter** — `name` and `description` only. No `enforcement`, `phase`, `standalone`, `requires`,
  or `model`.
- **Engine step** — a custom step wired in `.ai-conductor/config.yml` with `after: maintain-documentation`,
  `enforcement: gating`, and `completion_artifact: .pipeline/release-disposition-pass`. It lands before
  `finish` and inherits the SHIP loop-gate behavior. It pins `llm_provider: codex` and
  `model: gpt-5.6-terra`: the step judges a diff and writes a short structured disposition, so the
  standard Codex tier is sufficient; its structured output is validated by the required CI check.
- **Inputs** — the implementation diff, the retained SHIP draft PR, and the migration-surface classifier.
  The diff decides the disposition; the PR body is the authority once written.
- **Outputs** — structured metadata written directly to the PR body plus
  `.pipeline/release-disposition-review.md` and the PASS-only
  `.pipeline/release-disposition-pass` evidence marker. `finish` preserves the metadata while writing
  reader-facing PR content.
- **Gate role** — blocking. It fails closed when the draft cannot be read or updated, metadata is invalid,
  or a required migration is not runnable.

### scope-check

> Use before authoring any change to the ai-conductor harness repository, and before creating any new skill, to decide three things deterministically: whether the change is harness-repo-only or consumer-facing, whether a new skill belongs in the shipped `skills/` catalog or this repository's local `.agents/skills/` catalog, and whether the change is provider-agnostic. Produces a placement verdict and the registration steps that verdict requires.

- **Frontmatter** — `name` and `description` only. No `enforcement`, `phase`, `standalone`, `requires`,
  or `model`.
- **Engine step** — none. Operator-invoked, before authoring. Symlinked from `.claude/skills/scope-check`
  so both supported hosts discover the same file.
- **Inputs** — the change under consideration, plus this repository's own boundaries: `HARNESS.md`
  versus `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, the two skill catalogs, and the registration gates in
  `test/test_harness_integrity.sh` and `test/test_provider_skill_contracts.sh`.
- **Outputs** — three verdicts (audience, catalog, provider) plus the registration list the verdicts
  require. No repository file artifact. The verdicts are an input to the author's decision, not the
  decision itself: `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → Scope Decisions requires a conflict between a verdict and
  the operator's plain request to be surfaced before landing.
- **Gate role** — neither. Advisory, with no marker file and no HALT. Its value is that the
  registration cost of the two catalogs differs sharply: a `skills/` addition must satisfy integrity
  checks 2, 4, 5, 5a, and 5b plus the provider contract audit and installs globally, while an
  `.agents/skills/` addition is outside all of them.

### write-tests

> Use whenever adding, changing, reviewing, or debugging tests in the ai-conductor repository. Defines repository-specific test scope, isolation, mocking, fixture, performance, and CI-parity rules that prevent cyclic Conductor runs, leaked workers, real third-party calls, and slow aggregate suites. Complements the provider-neutral tdd skill, which controls implementation order rather than test design.

- **Frontmatter** — `name` and `description` only. It is the only skill in the repository with no
  `enforcement` field.
- **Engine step** — none. It is unwired: no step definition, no custom config step, no engine reference.
- **Inputs** — the test under authorship plus repository conventions.
- **Outputs** — none. It produces test files and prescribes commands.
- **Gate role** — neither. No verdict, no marker file, no downstream HALT. Its rules are stated as MUST
  and never, and the repository's contributor instructions make it mandatory reading. See
  [testing](../contributing/testing.md).

## Agent personas

16 persona files live under `agents/`. A persona is a prompt template defining *who* does the work; a
skill decides *when* to dispatch one and with what scoped context. Dispatch is by the host agent's
subagent facility, not by the engine — the engine dispatches skills, and skills dispatch personas.

| Persona | Role | Dispatched by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generator.md` | Writes tests (RED) and code (GREEN) under strict TDD in an isolated, focused context | `tdd`, `pipeline` |
| `evaluator.md` | Fresh-context quality evaluator over a scoped batch diff, with no shared state with the generator | `pipeline` at batch boundaries, `code-review` |
| `domain-reviewer.md` | Domain integrity reviewer with veto authority over tests and implementations | `tdd` at both DOMAIN phases, `code-review` |
| `prd-auditor.md` | Audits one `FR-N` against shipped code; finding authority, never fixes | `prd-audit` |
| `remediation-planner.md` | Emits per-gap dispositions and concrete tasks; planning authority, never edits code | `remediate` |
| `worktree-manager.md` | Git worktree lifecycle: creation, environment setup, merge-back, conflict resolution, proof-gated cleanup | `pipeline` |
| `cto-security.md` | Authn/authz, input validation, OWASP top 10, vulnerability surface | `assess` |
| `cto-data-integrity.md` | Transactions, event sourcing, race conditions, migrations | `assess` |
| `cto-dependencies.md` | Outdated packages, CVEs, license compliance, blocked upgrades | `assess` |
| `cto-architecture.md` | Decisions versus implementation, module consistency, coupling | `assess` |
| `cto-duplication.md` | Boilerplate and copy-paste clusters with blast-radius measurement | `assess` |
| `cto-testing.md` | Coverage gaps, layer balance, assertion quality, missing negatives | `assess` |
| `cto-infrastructure.md` | Connection pooling, caching, background jobs, production parity, secrets | `assess` |
| `cto-observability.md` | Error handling, logging quality, monitoring, debug context | `assess` |
| `cto-devex.md` | Onboarding, CI/CD, local development, documentation accuracy | `assess` |
| `cto-orchestrator.md` | Reads all nine specialist reports and produces one prioritized assessment | `assess` |

`assess` therefore dispatches ten personas: the nine specialists plus the orchestrator.

## Known limitations

The frontmatter is not always the truth. Where a skill's declared `enforcement` disagrees with its
engine step definition, **the engine wins** — `isGatingStep` and `canSkipStep` read the step
definition, never the SKILL.md.

> **Known limitation.** Six skills' `enforcement:` frontmatter disagrees with the engine's step
> definition. A reader who trusts the frontmatter will predict the wrong skippability.
>
> | Skill | SKILL.md `enforcement` | Engine step enforcement |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | `memory` | `gating` | `advisory` |
> | `assess` | `gating` | `advisory` |
> | `architecture-diagram` | `gating` | `advisory` |
> | `architecture-review` | `gating` | `advisory` (the DECIDE step) |
> | `remediate` | `gating` | `advisory` |
> | `rebase` | `advisory` | `structural` |
>
> The sharpest case is `architecture-review`: the SKILL.md declares a HARD GATE — no feature proceeds
> past it with DRAFT ADRs — but the DECIDE-phase step is `advisory`, so `canSkipStep('architecture_review')`
> returns `true`. The real enforcement for that half lives in the land-time spec gate and in `conduct`'s
> DRAFT-ADR block, not in the step's enforcement level. The as-built half at index 18 is genuinely
> `gating` and fail-closed. Tracked in
> [#1018](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1018).

> **Known limitation.** `manual-test/SKILL.md` declares `requires: [finish, verify-claims]` and its
> description says "Use after /finish". The engine runs `manual_test` at index 16 with prerequisite
> `test_suite`, and `finish` at index 21 with prerequisite `rebase`. `finish` is not a prerequisite of
> `manual_test` in any code path — the declared dependency is inverted relative to execution order.
> Follow the engine order. Tracked in
> [#1018](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1018).

> **Known limitation.** `conduct/SKILL.md`'s tier table claims that tier S skips `pipeline` ("use direct
> /tdd") and `code-review` ("domain review in TDD suffices"). Neither is implemented. `build` declares
> `skippableForTiers: []` and is `structural`, so it can be neither tier-skipped nor config-disabled;
> `code-review` is not an engine step at all, and the engine's separate `build_review` step is likewise
> never tier-skipped. The same file's "Small flow" summary also omits `complexity`, `worktree`,
> `build_review`, `wiring_check`, `test_suite`, and `rebase`, all of which run at tier S. The
> authoritative tier-S skip set is the 8 steps listed in [steps](steps.md). Tracked in
> [#1018](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1018).
