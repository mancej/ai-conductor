# `conduct-ts` CLI reference

Every command, subcommand, flag, and exit code of the `conduct-ts` engine. Commands are grouped
operator-first: the ones you type, then the ones the engine invokes on your behalf.

The legacy bash `bin/conduct` is deprecated and is not documented here — use `conduct-ts`.

## Launcher

`bin/conduct-ts` is a shim. It parses none of its own arguments and passes everything through to the
bundled engine at `src/conductor/dist/index.js`, resolving the `dist` symlink to a concrete
`dist-versions/<id>/index.js` so a running process is pinned to one engine version. It exports
`ASDF_NODEJS_VERSION` from `src/conductor/.tool-versions` when `asdf` is on `PATH`, then `exec`s node,
so the engine's exit code is the shim's. The current pin is Node.js `26.7.0`, and the engine requires
Node `>=26.0.0` when the asdf override is unavailable.

| Condition | Message | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dist` neither exists nor is a symlink | `conduct-ts: missing …` plus `run 'npm run build' in src/conductor/` | 1 |
| `dist` symlink unresolvable or not a regular file | `conduct-ts: dist symlink is broken (…)` | 1 |
| Uncaught engine error | `Fatal: <message>` | 1 |

`bin/intake-file`, `bin/intake-backfill`, and `bin/quarantine-engineer-signals` are separate entry
points, not `conduct-ts` subcommands.

## `bin/install`

```bash
bin/install --channel <stable|tagged|main>
```

On a first install, `--channel` records the selected update channel without prompting. It takes
precedence over `AI_CONDUCTOR_CHANNEL`; with neither explicit value, an interactive installer prompts
and a non-interactive installer falls back to `stable`. Empty environment values are treated as unset;
an invalid explicit value exits before installation writes global state. The option is first-run only:
change an existing selection with `bin/update --set-channel`.

## `bin/update`

```bash
bin/update
bin/update --auto
bin/update --set-channel <stable|tagged|main>
```

With no arguments, forces an attended check of the configured harness update channel. `--auto` honors
`conductor.auto_check` and is the startup form spawned by `conduct-ts`. `--set-channel` accepts
`stable`, `tagged`, or `main` and changes configuration without moving the checkout.

`stable` is the fresh-install default. It fetches `origin/stable`, verifies that its head is an exact
semver tag, requires a clean local `stable` checkout and a fast-forward relationship, then prompts
before fast-forwarding to that captured commit and running `bin/migrate`. An untagged target is rejected
before local mutation. If migration fails after the fast-forward, the updater restores the prior `stable`
branch head and recorded version.
`tagged` follows semver tag checkouts; `main` follows every merge to the development branch.

## `bin/migrate`

```bash
bin/migrate [--yes|-y] [--dry-run]
```

Runs `bin/install --update`, then, from a consumer project, finds runnable `bash migration` fences in
each release through the installed target version. If it cannot read the installed-version
configuration, it exits non-zero before selecting migrations. On a project's first run, the lower
bound is the recorded `currentVersion` (or the target version itself, if `currentVersion` is an
unparsable channel identity such as `main@<sha>`); that bound is then pinned into the ledger as its
`candidateBaseline` and used on every later run, so it stays fixed even as `currentVersion` advances.
It exports `HARNESS_DIR` to every block. Blocks are ordered by release version and document position.

`--dry-run` shows the install action and selected migrations without executing or recording them.
Without `--yes`, an interactive run previews each block and accepts `yes`, `no`, `all`, or `stop`;
skipped and stopped blocks remain pending. Without a TTY and without `--yes`, it executes no project
migrations and leaves every block pending. `--yes` executes each selected block without prompts.

After each successful block, the runner records its release and content digest in a per-project,
human-readable ledger under `~/.ai-conductor/migrations/`. A recorded digest is already applied;
changed content at the same release is a new candidate. A failed block stops the run immediately:
earlier successful blocks remain recorded and later blocks remain pending. Unknown flags exit 2.
Every run, including a failure, ends with `Migration summary: applied=<n> skipped=<n> failed=<n>
already-applied=<n>`.

## Exit code conventions

| Code | Meaning | Where it appears |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Success, or an advisory command that never blocks | most commands |
| 1 | Usage error, validation failure, or a refused operation | most commands |
| 2 | Usage guide printed to stderr | `task`, `evidence`, `derive-feedback` |

Commands that are advisory by contract always exit 0 regardless of outcome: `overlap-scan`, `kpi`,
`shipped-record`, `shipment-evidence audit`, and `render-diagrams` in its default (non-`--check`) mode.

## Daemon-session refusal

Every provider session the engine dispatches (daemon builds, reviews, interactive-conductor steps,
self-host candidates — both providers, invoke and interactive paths) carries
`CONDUCT_DAEMON_SESSION=1` in its environment. When that marker is present, `conduct-ts` refuses to
run — printing `conduct-ts may not be invoked from inside a daemon-managed session; the engine owns
all conductor operations for this run` and exiting 1 — before any subcommand parsing. This exists
because dispatched maker sessions have recursively invoked the conductor (including `daemon
park`/`unpark`/`restart` and `reseal`), corrupting the run that dispatched them; the engine that
started the session owns all conductor operations for it. The only exceptions are the
session-sanctioned worker commands the harness's own skills and hooks require a session to run —
`scoped-run`, `overlap-scan`, `plan-protected-targets`, `manual-test-record`, `closeout-event`, and
`derive-feedback` — which stay available under the marker. There is no config off-switch;
enforcement lives in `src/conductor/src/execution/daemon-session.ts`.

## `conduct-ts build-review`

```bash
conduct-ts build-review findings --feature <slug> [--json]
conduct-ts build-review accept --feature <slug> --lap <lap> --finding <id> --rationale <text>
conduct-ts build-review record-reduced-coverage --feature <slug> --lap <lap> --rubric <rubric> --rationale <text>
```

`findings` is read-only and renders the current feature's raw and effective build-review findings;
`--json` selects machine-readable output. `accept` changes state only from an interactive terminal with
a resolved local operator identity. It requires the exact current lap identity, canonical finding ID,
and a non-empty rationale. Acceptance works on every registered rubric — currently only `testQuality` —
because the identity the engine prints is the identity the disposition store accepts back. Stale, unknown, unauthorized, or non-interactive requests are refused without changing
artifacts and exit 1; successful findings inspection and accepted exact-current findings exit 0.
A refusal names the check that failed — unreadable aggregate, non-current lap, unknown finding, or a
disposition-store rejection — and records the same reason on the feature's
`build_review_disposition_refused` event. `record-reduced-coverage` also requires an interactive
terminal, resolved local operator identity, exact current lap, named rubric, and non-empty rationale.
It derives the closed infrastructure cause from the current review state; callers cannot supply one.
It records a decision only when that rubric currently has an exhausted mechanical infrastructure
fault. Judged, skipped, duplicate, unknown-rubric, allowance-remaining, and stale-review requests
are refused without changing the decision state.

## `conduct-ts scope-check`

```bash
conduct-ts scope-check <commit-message-path>
```

This hook-only command is invoked by the generated `commit-msg` hook for a task-attributed commit. It reads
the active in-progress task row from `.pipeline/task-status.json`, compares its declared files with the staged
paths, and prints every undeclared path with a `Scope: <path> — <rationale>` trailer that can justify an
intentional widening. It is not an operator workflow; worktree provisioning wires it automatically.

| Exit | Meaning | Hook behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Allowed, including a verified violation in the default report-only mode | Allows the commit; a reported violation remains visible in containment-floor step output and warnings |
| 2 | Positive scope refusal when `build_review.scopeContainmentEnforced` is `true` | `commit-msg` converts it to exit 1 and blocks the commit without changing the working tree or index |
| other | Abstention: no Task trailer, unusable/missing task state, or a checker failure | Logs the abstention and allows the commit |

The report-only default is deliberate. Set `build_review.scopeContainmentEnforced: true` to enable refusal.
A `Scope:` trailer documents a widening; its path, rationale, task id, and commit SHA are supplied directly to
`build_review`, and it never bypasses the grader's semantic scope judgment.

## `conduct-ts inline`

Runs the SDLC pipeline in the foreground.

```bash
conduct-ts inline [options] "<feature description>"
```

The `inline` token is mandatory. A bare `conduct-ts "<feature>"` is rejected with three lines of
guidance and exit 1. Commander declares an `inline` subcommand so `conduct-ts inline --help` renders,
but it never dispatches it — the engine strips the `inline` token first and parses the remainder
against a subcommand-less base program, which is why a free-text feature description is never mistaken
for an unknown command.

| Positional | Arity | Required | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[feature]` | 0..1 | conditional | Feature description. Drives slug and worktree naming and auto-resume matching. |

A feature description is required unless at least one state flag is present. The state flags are
`--resume`, `--status`, `--cleanup`, `--reset`, `--diagnose`, `--report`, and `--from`.
Without one, parsing throws `Feature description is required when no state flags are provided` and the
run exits 1.

| Flag | Type | Default | Constraints | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--resume` | boolean | `false` | — | With a feature description, honored by the auto-resume gate and clamps the start index. Without one, cleans up merged worktrees, scans `.worktrees/`, and shows a selection menu (exit 1 when no features are found), then repoints `projectRoot`, `pipelineDir`, and the state file at the selected worktree. |
| `--fresh` | boolean | `false` | — | Suppresses auto-resume detection so an existing worktree for the same slug is not silently reused. This is its only effect; it is never passed to the engine's conductor object. |
| `--auto` | boolean | `false` | deprecated; mutually exclusive with `--interactive` | Prints `Error: --auto is deprecated. Use \`conduct-ts daemon start\` instead.` and exits 1 before starting the inline pipeline. Use the daemon for unattended execution and retained logs. |
| `--interactive` | boolean | `false` | mutually exclusive with `--auto` | Run mode `interactive`: opens a Claude REPL for every conversational step except `complexity`, `conflict_check`, `architecture_diagram`, `retro`, and `rebase`. `dangerouslySkipPermissions` stays off, so a human approves each action. |
| `--status` | boolean | `false` | — | Prints `## Conductor State` and the state file as pretty JSON, then returns. No provider session. |
| `--from <step>` | string | — | must be a step name | Sets the start index to that step. Also suppresses auto-resume. An unrecognized step name exits 1, printing the invalid value and every valid step name (built-ins plus any config-declared custom steps). |
| `--cleanup` | boolean | `false` | — | Scans resumable features, reads `pr_url` from each `conduct-state.json`, checks whether the PR merged, and prompts `Remove merged worktree "<name>"? [y/n]` per merged feature. Prints a count. |
| `--reset` | boolean | `false` | — | Writes an empty state object, prints `State cleared.`, and returns. |
| `--diagnose` | boolean | `false` | — | Non-mutating. Resolves the worktree, then verifies state completeness. State OK prints `State OK…` and exits 0; gaps print a gap report plus remediation text to stderr and exit 1; an orphaned state exits 1. |
| `--report` | boolean | `false` | — | Read-only. Renders `.pipeline/events.jsonl` as step durations, retry hotspots, and token spend, then exits 0. A report error exits 1. No provider session. |
| `--cooldown <seconds>` | integer | `10` | no range check | Seconds to pause between steps. A non-numeric value parses to `NaN`. |
| `--model <name>` | string | — | alias or full model ID | Overrides the model for every step. Beats every configured source. See [models](models.md). |
| `--effort <level>` | string | — | one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | Overrides the effort for every step. Beats every configured source. An invalid level exits 1, printing the invalid value and the valid levels. |
| `--view <mode>` | enum | `full` | `full`, `focus`, `log` | Dashboard layout. Anything other than exactly `focus` or `log` silently coerces to `full`. |
| `--tail-lines <n>` | integer | `20` | `0` disables the pane | Maximum lines of post-step stdout shown in the tail pane. |
| `-h`, `--help` | boolean | — | — | Prints help and exits 0. |

Passing both `--auto` and `--interactive` prints `Error: --auto and --interactive are mutually
exclusive` and exits 1. Passing `--auto` alone prints its daemon-directed deprecation notice and
exits 1.

### Auto-resume

When a feature description is given and none of `--resume`, `--fresh`, or `--from` is
present, the engine looks for an existing worktree for that slug.

| Detection | Behavior | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resumable | Redirects to the worktree and prints `Resuming "<desc>" at <n>/<total> (after <step>). Use --fresh to start over.` | continues |
| Complete, evidence intact | Prompts `Feature "<desc>" is already marked complete (<path>). Start over? [y/N]`; anything but `y` returns | 0 |
| Complete, evidence gaps | Prints the gap report, prompts `Roll back feature_status and resume at the first failing step? [Y/n/q]`; the default deletes `feature_status`, flips each failed step to `pending`, and resumes | continues |
| Orphaned state | Lists the expected worktree locations and two remedies, then refuses | 1 |

Recovery procedures live in [worktree and evidence recovery](../runbooks/worktree-and-evidence-recovery.md).

### Side effects of a run

An `inline` run creates `.pipeline/`, ensures `.claude/settings.json` exists with project-scoped
permissions, loads `.ai-conductor/config.yml` (a non-`missing` config error exits 1) and the merged
user config, reads or creates `.pipeline/conduct-session-id`, discovers plugins under
`$HOME/.ai-conductor/plugins` and `<projectRoot>/.ai-conductor/plugins`, appends to
`.pipeline/events.jsonl` and `.pipeline/audit-trail/events.jsonl`, may run the `/bootstrap` and
`/assess` prelude, spawns `bin/update --auto` in the background with all failures swallowed, and
creates or cleans git worktrees. It starts every compatible discovered `visualizer` plugin on the live
event bus and flushes each one at shutdown; OTel export is opt-in and off unless configured. The
visualizer contract and failure posture are in
[extending the harness](../contributing/extending.md#add-a-visualizer-plugin).

## `conduct-ts daemon`

Runs the background build/ship loop, or manages one. Procedures are in
[running the daemon](../guides/running-the-daemon.md); this section is the flag surface.

`--help` or `-h` anywhere after `daemon` short-circuits to daemon help and exits 0. That guard is
deliberately checked before every daemon dispatcher — without it, `daemon --help` would be treated as
an unknown flag and launch a daemon run.

A non-flag token after `daemon` that is not one of `status`, `logs`, `park`, `unpark`,
`reclaim-worktree`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `connect`, `debug`, `pause`, `resume` prints
`conduct daemon: unknown subcommand '<token>'.` plus the daemon help to stderr and exits 1.

### Running the daemon

```bash
conduct-ts daemon [--concurrency <n>] [--max-items <n>] [--continuous] [--max-cost <tokens>]
                  [--max-runtime <seconds>] [--idle-poll <seconds>] [--max-idle-polls <n>]
                  [--no-watch] [--completed | --all]
```

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--concurrency <n>` | integer | `1` | Requested worker count. Any value above 1 is clamped to 1 and logged as `concurrency clamped to 1 (serial …)`. |
| `--max-items <n>` | integer | unset | Stop after this many features. |
| `--continuous` | boolean | `false` | Idle-poll instead of draining the backlog once. |
| `--max-cost <tokens>` | integer | unset | Total output-token ceiling for the run. |
| `--max-runtime <seconds>` | integer | unset | Wall-clock ceiling for the run. |
| `--idle-poll <seconds>` | integer | `60` | Seconds between polls when the backlog is empty. |
| `--max-idle-polls <n>` | integer | unbounded | Stop after this many consecutive empty polls. |
| `--no-watch` | boolean | watcher on | Drops the HALT-marker filesystem watcher and relies on polling alone. Not listed in `--help`. |
| `--completed`, `--all` | boolean | `false` | Include already-processed features in the startup dashboard's console output. The persisted log sink never includes them. Not listed in `--help`. |

> **Known limitation.** `--concurrency` accepts any integer, but the run loop clamps every value above
> 1 down to 1, so `--concurrency 4` behaves exactly like `--concurrency 1` and only the clamp notice
> tells you. Real multi-feature concurrency is out of scope for the current run loop (ADR-014 /
> FR-13). Tracked in [#568](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/568).

> **Known limitation.** `--idle-poll`'s help string reports a default of 5 seconds; the code supplies
> 60 when the flag is absent, so an unflagged `--continuous` daemon polls once a minute, not every five
> seconds. Pass `--idle-poll` explicitly if the interval matters. Tracked in
> [#1012](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1012).

Every integer flag reads the next token, and a token beginning with `--` is treated as absent. So
`conduct-ts daemon --max-items --continuous` silently uses the default for `--max-items` rather than
reporting an error.

`--continuous` with no ceiling — no `--max-items`, `--max-cost`, `--max-runtime`, or
`--max-idle-polls` — prints `WARNING: --continuous with no ceiling … runs unbounded; Ctrl-C to stop.`

When a tmux session for the repo already exists, a bare `daemon` run wires a self-restart handler so a
queued restart respawns the pane at the next idle boundary instead of exiting.

A daemon run discovers the same global and project plugins as `inline` and starts every compatible
`visualizer` on the daemon-wide event bus. Feature-scoped events already forwarded to that bus reach
the plugins live. The daemon flushes the started plugins when the run drains or stops; plugin startup,
handler, and shutdown failures are isolated as described in
[extending the harness](../contributing/extending.md#add-a-visualizer-plugin).

### `daemon status`

```bash
conduct-ts daemon status
```

Takes no flags. Sweeps the project registry and prints one badge line per repo: state, name, path,
`pid`, `since`, `version:<engine-version-id>`, pause metadata, the last log line with its mtime, and
`session:up` or `session:down`. It then prints a `GATED:` section from `.daemon/gated.json`, a
`BLOCKED` section from `.daemon/blocked.json`, and an `attribution agreement: N% (n=…)` line from
`.daemon/attribution-accuracy.jsonl`; all are skipped for repos whose path is missing.

`BLOCKED` is the last completed discovery pass: every line contains the slug, machine-readable
reason, and remediation text, followed by the snapshot age. An empty valid snapshot prints that no
specs are blocked. If the snapshot is missing, malformed, or unreadable, status reports blocked
state unknown rather than implying an all-clear. This is a read-only local-file view: it does not
invoke Git, GitHub, or the network. The daemon startup dashboard does not yet render this section;
that UI work is tracked in [#1332](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1332).

For every in-progress feature it also prints a `PLAN GROWTH [<slug>]:` line reading the feature's
kickback ledger and resolved `prd_audit` cap: the plan's authored task count, the number of tasks added
so far (broken down by the gate that added them, when any), and how many remain under the cap.

Nine rendered states. `restart-pending` and `dead-pane` are overlays: they take precedence in the
badge, but the underlying liveness and pause facts stay on the row.

| Badge | State | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `● running` | `running` | Live pid owns `.daemon/daemon.pid`. |
| `⏸ paused` | `paused` | `.daemon/PAUSED` present, pid alive or absent. |
| `⏸ paused (process dead)` | `paused_dead` | Pause marker present and the pidfile owner is dead. |
| `○ stale` | `stale` | Pidfile present, its owner pid is dead and reclaimable. |
| `· stopped` | `stopped` | No pidfile, or a corrupt one, and no pause marker. |
| `✗ path missing` | `path-missing` | The registered path no longer exists. |
| `✗ unreadable` | `unreadable` | The repo's daemon state could not be inspected. |
| `⏳ restart-pending` | `restart-pending` | `.daemon/RESTART-PENDING` is queued. Renders as `⏳ restart-pending (waiting on <slug>)` when it names a blocking feature. |
| `⚠ session-up/process-dead` | `dead-pane` | The tmux session exists but its pane has died. Never the same as `running`. |

Exit 0 for any sweep, including one that reports stale or missing entries. Exit 1 only when the
registry itself cannot be read. An empty registry prints
`No projects registered. Use conduct register [path] to add one.` and exits 0.

### `daemon logs`

```bash
conduct-ts daemon logs [--repo <path>] [--follow] [--all] [--lines <n>]
```

Reads `.daemon/daemon.log`.

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--repo <path>`, `--repo=<path>` | path | cwd | Repo whose log is read. |
| `--follow`, `-f` | boolean | `false` | Streams appended lines from the current end of file until SIGINT. `-f` is not listed in `--help`. |
| `--all` | boolean | `false` | Iterates the registry, printing a `==> <path> <==` header per repo. |
| `--lines <n>`, `-n <n>`, `--lines=<n>` | integer | whole file | Tail length. A non-integer or non-positive value is ignored and the whole file is printed. Not listed in `--help`. |

`--follow` with `--all` prints `--follow is not supported with --all; showing a static snapshot.` and
does not follow. A missing log prints `(no daemon log yet for <path>)` and contributes 0. Exit 1 when a
log is unreadable, or when `--all` is used and the registry cannot be read.

### `daemon park` and `daemon unpark`

```bash
conduct-ts daemon park <slug>
conduct-ts daemon unpark <slug>
```

Both act directly on the filesystem before any daemon boot, and both resolve the main repo root via
`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, so they work from inside any worktree.

`park` validates the slug — either `.docs/plans/<slug>.md` or `.worktrees/<slug>` must exist — and
writes `.daemon/parked/<slug>`. It prints `Parked '<slug>' — it will not be dispatched or re-kicked
until unparked.` plus `Marked for park: <path>`. An already-parked slug prints `'<slug>' is already
parked (originally parked at <ts>) — no change.` and exits 0. An unknown slug exits 1.

`unpark` resets the no-evidence attempt counter first, then removes the park marker, so a failed reset
leaves the marker in place for a retry. A slug that was never parked prints `'<slug>' was not
operator-parked — nothing to do.` and exits 0.

Running either outside a conduct project prints `not inside a conduct project — run 'daemon park
<slug>' from the project root or any directory inside it` and exits 1.

> **Known limitation.** `conduct-ts daemon park` with no slug does not print park usage. The slug-less
> form falls through every daemon dispatcher to the inline refusal and prints `conduct: the inline SDLC
> pipeline now runs under the inline subcommand.` before exiting 1 — a message unrelated to parking.
> Always pass the slug. Tracked in [#1012](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1012).

### `daemon reconcile-parked`

```bash
conduct-ts daemon reconcile-parked <slug>
```

Runs the same guarded cleanup the daemon's own idle-tick sweep uses, on demand, for one parked
feature. Like `park`/`unpark`, it validates its argument shape and resolves the main repo root
before any other work, so it works from inside any worktree.

A missing or malformed slug never reaches Git: no slug prints `Usage: conduct daemon
reconcile-parked <slug>` and exits 1; a slug that fails `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$` prints `Could not
reconcile '<slug>': invalid-slug` and exits 1.

For a valid slug, the command checks whether the slug's work reached `origin/main` — either a
`.docs/shipped/<stem>.md` record committed there (matched allowing for the `YYYY-MM-DD-` plan-date
prefix), or a local branch ending in `/<slug>` under any prefix that `git merge-base --is-ancestor`
proves is contained in `origin/main`. If neither holds, or the check fails, it prints `Could not
reconcile '<slug>': <reason>` and exits 1. The refusal reason identifies the proof that is missing:

- `branch-missing` — no local branch for the slug is available to prove.
- `no-merge-proof` — the branch is not an ancestor and no merged PR proves its current tip.
- `unmerged-commits` — the branch has commits beyond the merged PR head. The command prints up to
  ten `SHA subject` lines after the refusal, followed by `… and M more` when the list is longer.
- `branch-behind-merged-head` — the local branch tip no longer matches the merged PR head proof.
- `ancestry-check-failed` — Git or merged-PR evidence could not be checked safely.

These refusals leave every branch and worktree in place. If the slug is
merged but `.docs/shipped/<slug>.md` does not exist on `origin/main`, it requests an ST-916
record-repair PR when a merged PR can be found, prints `Could not reconcile '<slug>':
record-missing`, and exits 1 — the same deferral the daemon sweep applies until the shipped record
lands. A shipped record on `origin/main` settles completion on its own, so local per-worktree
`.pipeline/` state that still reads mid-build never refuses cleanup.

Once merged and recorded, it removes `.worktrees/<slug>`, deletes every local
branch for the slug, and unparks the slug — the same three steps
[park before you touch a feature's git state](../guides/running-the-daemon.md#park-a-feature-before-you-touch-its-git-state)
describes doing by hand. It prints `Reconciled '<slug>': worktree-removed, branch-deleted,
unparked` and exits 0. When the branch was already deleted at merge — the normal end state for
shipped work — the middle step reads `branch-absent` instead. When `.worktrees/<slug>` exists on disk
but git never registered it as a worktree, the directory is removed outright rather than refused.
A failure partway through prints `Could not reconcile '<slug>':
worktree-remove-failed`, `branch-delete-failed`, or `unpark-failed` and exits 1, leaving whatever
steps completed in place.

See [park a feature before you touch its git state](../guides/running-the-daemon.md#park-a-feature-before-you-touch-its-git-state)
for the automatic sweep this verb shares its logic with.

### `daemon reclaim-worktree`

```bash
conduct-ts daemon reclaim-worktree <slug>
```

Removes exactly one named, retained feature worktree — the manual counterpart to the automatic
reap described in [retained worktrees](../guides/running-the-daemon.md#retained-worktrees). It
never bulk-deletes: only a single `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*` slug is accepted, so a traversal
(`../other`), a glob (`*`), a path (`nested/path`), a list (`one,two`), or more than one argument
each print `Could not reclaim-worktree '<slug>': invalid-slug` and exit 1.

A slug with no `.worktrees/<slug>` directory prints `No retained worktree to reclaim for
'<slug>'.` and exits 0 — reclaiming an already-gone worktree is not an error. A slug with a resume
in progress prints `Could not reclaim-worktree '<slug>': in-progress` and exits 1, so the verb
never races a live build.

Otherwise it prints `Reclaiming retained worktree: <path>`, removes the worktree, then prints
`Removed retained worktree '<slug>': <path>` and exits 0. A removal failure prints `Could not
reclaim-worktree '<slug>': <error message>` and exits 1, leaving the worktree in place.

Like `park`/`unpark`/`reconcile-parked`, it resolves the main repo root via `git rev-parse
--git-common-dir` before doing any other work, so it works from inside any worktree.

### Daemon management verbs

```bash
conduct-ts daemon start [-D | --detach] [--attach-into <target>]
conduct-ts daemon stop
conduct-ts daemon restart [<name>…] [--all]
conduct-ts daemon connect [--write] [--attach-into <target>]
conduct-ts daemon debug [--attach-into <target>]
conduct-ts daemon pause [<name>…] [--all]
conduct-ts daemon resume [<name>…] [--all]
```

These drive a tmux-hosted supervisor. All exit 0 on success and 1 on any error, including tmux not
being installed. Management verbs and direct daemon runs resolve the main repository root from the
current directory before launch; daemon logs, PID files, and other runtime state therefore stay
under the root `.daemon/` directory even when invoked from a nested package or linked worktree.

| Verb | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `start` | Refreshes a stale install first — a stale install never starts a daemon — then starts the session. Auto-attaches read-only when the terminal is interactive and `--detach` was not passed; otherwise prints `daemon started (detached). Attach with 'conduct daemon connect'.` or `daemon started (no interactive terminal to attach to)…`. `--attach-into <target>` (see below) always attaches, even with `--detach` or no TTY. |
| `stop` | Kills the tmux session. |
| `restart` | A paused daemon counts as idle. Busy: writes `.daemon/RESTART-PENDING` and returns `restart queued: daemon is busy on <slug>; it will restart automatically once idle.` Idle: clears a stale lock, reconciles an orphaned process (SIGTERM, 100 ms, SIGKILL, reclaim), relinks skills, and recreates the session. The outcome message always prints, so a degraded restart is visible. |
| `connect` | Attaches read-only. Detach with `Ctrl-b d`. Pass `--write` to attach read-write instead — the same subcommand you already reached for to look, now with input, no need to already know about `debug`. |
| `debug` | Attaches read-write. Unchanged; kept as a discoverable alias alongside `connect --write`. |
| `pause` | Writes the durable pause marker; an already-paused daemon reports `already paused`. Listed in `--help`. |
| `resume` | Removes the pause marker; a daemon that is not paused reports `not paused`. Listed in `--help`. |

| Flag | Applies to | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-D`, `--detach` | `start` | Skips the auto-attach. Parsed on every verb but only meaningful here. |
| `--write` | `connect` | Requests a read-write attach instead of the default read-only. Ignored elsewhere — `debug` is already read-write. |
| `--attach-into <target>` | `start`, `connect`, `debug` | Delivers the attach into an already-open tmux pane elsewhere on the same tmux server — a session, `session:window`, or `session:window.pane` target string — instead of taking over this process's own controlling terminal. Fixes running any of these from a shell that is itself already inside a tmux client, which otherwise hits tmux's own nesting guard (`sessions should be nested with care, unset $TMUX to force`): the attach command is typed into the target pane via `tmux send-keys`, wrapped in `env -u TMUX` so tmux does not refuse it there. Never touches this process's own stdio, so it works with no TTY and bypasses `start`'s `--detach`/no-TTY skip. Example: `conduct daemon connect --write --attach-into mywindow:1.0` to view-and-drive the daemon in a specific pane you already have open. |
| `--all` | `pause`, `resume`, `restart` | Applies the verb to every registered repo instead of the cwd repo. Not listed in `--help`. |
| `<name>…` | `pause`, `resume`, `restart` | Bare tokens after the verb select named repos from the registry. Not listed in `--help`. |

In fleet mode each repo gets its own error boundary, so one failure never aborts the sweep. Per-repo
`restart` outcomes are paused → respawn, idle → respawn, busy → queued, stopped with no session →
`daemon started (was stopped)`, error → reported and the sweep continues.

## `conduct-ts engineer`

The interactive idea-to-spec loop plus its deterministic primitives. The procedure is in
[the engineer loop guide](../guides/engineer-loop.md).

Two rules apply to every subcommand. `--help` or `-h` is checked before the subcommand's own logic, so
it prints that subcommand's help and exits 0 with zero side effects. Any `--flag` not on a
subcommand's allow-list prints `engineer <sub>: unknown flag '<flag>' — run engineer <sub> --help for
usage.` to stderr and exits 1.

### Launching the loop

| Invocation | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `conduct-ts engineer` | Spawns an interactive `claude` session with inherited stdio and the `/engineer` prompt. |
| `conduct-ts engineer --idea "<text>"` | Same, with the idea appended to the prompt. The idea is one-shot — it applies only to the first session. Not declared in `--help`. |
| `conduct-ts engineer <free text…>` | A bare non-flag positional that is not a known subcommand is joined into an idea string. Not declared in `--help`. |
| malformed or unknown flag form | Prints the guide text and exits 0. |

The spawn is `claude --permission-mode <mode> '<prompt>'`, where `<mode>` comes from
[`CONDUCT_ENGINEER_PERMISSION_MODE`](environment.md). If `CLAUDECODE` is set the launch refuses to
nest a second interactive session, prints guidance to run `/engineer` directly, and returns 0.

Before each fresh session, and only when no idea came from the CLI, the loop polls GitHub issues into
the durable inbox and prints `Intake: N issue(s) queued.` for a non-zero N. That poll is skipped
entirely while a background brain loop is alive. Ordinary poll failures print and never block; a
corrupt ledger is the exception — it fails closed and exits 1 (see the subcommand table below).

After each session exits, the loop prompts `Process another idea in a fresh session? [Y/n]` on a TTY.
Non-TTY stdin answers no, so the loop never runs unattended. The child's exit code is returned; a spawn
failure — `claude` not on `PATH`, for instance — prints an actionable message plus the guide and
returns 1.

### `engineer` subcommands

| Command | Syntax | Purpose | Exit codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capabilities` | `engineer capabilities` | Prints schema version 1 plus independent `engineerLifecycleEventsV1`, `engineerReadinessV1`, `engineerWorktreeRetirementV1`, `engineerRetainedReviewWorktreesV1`, and `engineerOwnedAttemptsV1` booleans. Consumers gate each guarantee independently. | 0; 1 on unknown flag |
| `readiness-probe` | `engineer readiness-probe --repo-root <path> [--github-handoff\|--local-handoff] [--required-tools <csv>]` | Performs a read-only, non-persisting prerequisite check for repository identity, tools, remote reachability, authentication, and GitHub handoff posture. A successful read-only remote check reports `inconclusive` because push authorization is still unproven. | 0 for `ready` or `inconclusive`; 1 for `blocked` or invalid input |
| `run-readiness` | `engineer run-readiness --run-id <id> --repo-root <path> [--github-handoff\|--local-handoff] [--required-tools <csv>] [--permit-inconclusive]` | Runs the same check against one exact non-terminal run and persists `engineer_readiness_checked`. `--permit-inconclusive` explicitly authorizes the non-mutating push-authorization limitation. | 0 when the result permits authoring; 1 when blocked or not explicitly permitted |
| `run-create` | `engineer run-create --repo-root <path> --idea "<text>" [--correlation-id <opaque>] [--attempt-key <opaque>] [--integration-owner <opaque>]` | Reserves one durable Engineer attempt and prints its compact snapshot. The same repository, correlation id, attempt key, and owner are idempotent. A new attempt key is accepted only after the prior correlated run is terminal. An owned correlation requires the same owner unless an exact transfer was recorded. Omitted correlation and attempt keys are engine-minted. | 0; 1 on collision, a concurrent live attempt, owner mismatch, invalid input, or unknown flag |
| `run-inspect` | `engineer run-inspect --run-id <id>` or `engineer run-inspect --repo-root <path> --correlation-id <opaque>` | Prints one recovered run snapshot or the ordered attempts for one repository correlation. Correlated attempts keep separate run-local revision cursors. An unknown correlation or one owned by another repository prints `runs: []` for the requested repository. | 0, including an empty correlation result; 1 on a missing run id, corruption, schema-incompatible state, or unknown flag |
| `run-replay` | `engineer run-replay --run-id <id> --after-revision <n>` | Prints one JSON object containing events whose run-local `revision` is strictly greater than `n`. A cursor ahead of the journal fails instead of silently resetting. | 0; 1 on an invalid cursor, missing run, corruption, schema mismatch, or unknown flag |
| `run-record` | `engineer run-record --run-id <id> --transition <name> [transition flags]` | Records provider-neutral host and DECIDE transitions. Supported host transitions are `run_started`, `routing_selected`, `step_started`, `step_completed`, `step_failed`, `step_retried`, `step_skipped`, and `run_settled`. Step completion requires `--completion accepted_result` or `artifact_validation`; `land_reconciliation` is reserved for the engine-owned land path, and a tool return is not completion evidence. | 0; 1 on an illegal transition, invalid step/evidence, terminal reopen, or unknown flag |
| `run-cancel` | `engineer run-cancel --run-id <id> --reason <text>` | Appends a terminal cancellation event. The run is immutable afterward. | 0; 1 on an invalid or terminal run |
| `run-fail` | `engineer run-fail --run-id <id> --error <text>` | Classifies and appends a terminal failure with bounded class, code, summary, retryability, remedy, and redacted diagnostic while preserving the schema-compatible, equally redacted `error` field. A correlated retry uses a new attempt key and run id. | 0; 1 on an invalid or terminal run |
| `owner-transfer` | `engineer owner-transfer --repo-root <path> --correlation-id <id> --run-id <id> --current-owner <opaque> (--next-owner <opaque>\|--release) --expected-revision <n>` | Records one auditable, revision-bound transfer for the exact terminal predecessor. It is consumed by one direct successor and cannot rewrite prior runs. | 0; 1 on stale revision, identity mismatch, live predecessor, duplicate transfer, or invalid input |
| `worktree-cleanup` | `engineer worktree-cleanup --run-id <id> --reason <operator_cleanup\|task_cancelled\|spec_merged\|spec_closed\|retention_expired>` | Validates the exact marker, repository, registered worktree, branch, and commit; records logical retirement first; then removes that one worktree. An externally missing directory is complete only after its stale Git registration is removed or proven absent. Identity-precondition and removal failures persist typed evidence in the inspectable `cleanup` projection with retry timing. Removal debt never creates a second retirement event. | 0 after recording the resulting snapshot; 1 on identity or transition failure |
| `maintenance` | `engineer maintenance` | Reconciles retained review worktrees across durable Engineer runs. PR merge, PR close, cancellation, and deadline expiry authorize retirement; open PRs remain available. Failed PR-status lookups persist typed evidence and back off before another remote query. | 0 after the sweep; 1 on invalid input or an unrecoverable store error |
| `projects` | `engineer projects` | Prints the registry as JSON. Read-only. | 0; 1 on unknown flag |
| `worktree` | `engineer worktree --project <name> --idea "<text>" [--source-ref <ref>] [--body <text>] [--engineer-run-id <id>] [--permit-inconclusive]` | Resolves the project and creates the per-idea git worktree and branch. It validates a supplied run or creates an uncorrelated run, writes `.pipeline/engineer-run.json`, then prints `{kind, engineerRunId, slug, branch, worktreePath, reconcile}`. Inconclusive push authorization blocks authoring unless `--permit-inconclusive` is explicit. With `--source-ref` and no `--body`, it loads the persisted claim body; a missing record degrades to no staging. | 0; 1 on blocked or unpermitted readiness, project/identity resolution, lifecycle persistence, target resolution, or worktree creation error |
| `land` | `engineer land --project <name> --idea "<text>" --worktree <path> [--source-ref <ref>]` | Reads machine owner config, performs a fail-fast identity check, then commits the authored spec artifacts in the worktree onto `spec/<slug>`. With `--source-ref`, comments on the issue and advances the ledger to `routed` (advisory, so a `gh` failure never fails the land). A lifecycle reconciliation failure after the commit reports recovery guidance and retains the worktree; repair the durable state and rerun `engineer land` before handoff. | 0, including a warned lifecycle reconciliation failure after commit; 1 on project not found, unresolved identity, or a pre-commit land failure |
| `handoff` | `engineer handoff --project <name> --branch <branch> --worktree <path> [--source-ref <ref>] [--permit-inconclusive]` | Rechecks owned-run readiness, opens the spec PR with `gh` inside the per-idea worktree, durably records the exact retained commit and review deadline, and leaves the worktree registered. Inconclusive push authorization blocks handoff unless `--permit-inconclusive` is explicit. A blocked readiness result remains on the same authoring run so the exact landed worktree can retry handoff after repair. It prints `{kind:'pr-opened', url}` or `{kind:'local-commit', branch, repoPath, reason}` and starts the target daemon. Legacy unmarked worktrees remain supported and are retained without fabricated lifecycle evidence. With `--source-ref`, it performs the existing issue write-back. PR-open or readiness failure keeps the worktree. | 0 after delivered handoff, including warned advisory write-back failures; 1 on readiness, project, target, identity, or PR-open failure |
| `poll` | `engineer poll` | One synchronous sweep of the GitHub issues adapter, enqueuing every returned envelope into the durable inbox. Prints `{kind:'poll', enqueued, sourceRefs}`. No routing, no timer, no detached process; the ledger dedups, so a second poll enqueues nothing new. | 0; 1 on unknown flag |
| `claim` | `engineer claim` | Claims the oldest unblocked inbox entry. Before selecting work, it reaps stranded `claimed` entries older than `stale_claim_window_hours` (24 hours by default), returns them to pending, and may serve a reaped entry in that same claim. Builds a fresh blocker resolver per call and reads issue labels uncached. Prints `{empty:true}`, `{allBlocked:true, entries:[…]}`, or the claimed envelope. A real claim acks the queue, moves the ledger to `claimed`, and persists a claim record for a later `worktree --source-ref`. | always 0; 1 on unknown flag |
| `forget` | `engineer forget <sourceRef>` | Drops the ledger entry and strips the `engineer:handled` label so `poll` sees the issue again. An absent ref reports `{found:false}` and is not an error. Label removal is best-effort. | always 0; 1 on unknown flag |
| `unclaim` | `engineer unclaim <sourceRef>` | Single-entry maintenance: returns a `claimed` ledger entry without a recorded PR to pending while preserving its original capture time, so it can be claimed again. Missing, non-claimed, or PR-delivered entries report a non-error result and are left unchanged; resolve or forget a delivered entry instead. | 0 for handled or refused entries; 1 on unknown flag |
| `requeue` | `engineer requeue --stale [--older-than <dur>]` | Bulk maintenance: returns stale claimed entries without a recorded PR to pending; PR-bearing claimed entries are reserved for `resolve`/`forget` and never touched. Without `--older-than`, it uses `stale_claim_window_hours` (24 hours by default); the flag supplies a one-run duration override. Entries whose source issue is confirmed closed are removed instead; unconfirmed liveness failures are reported without removal. | 0 after the sweep; 1 on an unparseable `--older-than` or unknown flag |
| `resolve` | `engineer resolve <sourceRef> --pr-url <url> [--branch <branch>]` | Recovers a stranded entry that is `claimed` but never delivered by transitioning it to `done` with `{prUrl, branch}`. The branch is preserved when `--branch` is omitted. A missing entry reports `{found:false}`. | 0; 1 on a `--pr-url` that does not match `^https?://`; 1 on unknown flag |
| `migrate-issue-deps` | `engineer migrate-issue-deps [--confirm]` | One-time prose-to-structured-link dependency migration over open issues. Dry-run by default: prints the proposal, writes nothing, and reports `Dry run — no links written. Re-run with --confirm to apply.` With `--confirm`, applies the links and prints `N link(s) created, M already present.` | 0; 1 when the repo or issue list cannot be resolved; 1 on unknown flag |

### Engineer lifecycle JSON contract

Every successful lifecycle primitive prints exactly one parseable JSON value. Runtime lifecycle errors
raised after command parsing print one JSON error with `schemaVersion`, `error`, and `message` and exit 1.
Parse-time usage errors and unknown-flag rejections keep the pre-existing plain-text stderr convention and
also exit 1. The original capability name remains exactly `engineerLifecycleEventsV1`; the four
newer guarantees use the independent capability names in the table.

Each event has `schemaVersion: 1`, `engineerRunId`, nullable opaque `correlationId`, opaque
`attemptKey`, run `attempt`, nullable `previousEngineerRunId`, canonical `repoRoot`, monotonic
run-local `revision`, and ISO `ts`. The discriminants are:

`engineer_run_created`, `engineer_readiness_checked`, `engineer_run_started`, `engineer_routing_selected`,
`engineer_worktree_created`, `engineer_step_started`, `engineer_step_completed`,
`engineer_step_failed`, `engineer_step_retried`, `engineer_step_skipped`,
`engineer_land_reconciled`, `engineer_land_refused`, `engineer_spec_handoff`,
`engineer_run_cancelled`, `engineer_run_failed`, `engineer_run_settled`, and
`engineer_worktree_retired`.

The durable journal is
`$AI_CONDUCTOR_ENGINEER_DIR/lifecycle/runs/<engineerRunId>/events.jsonl`; the compact snapshot beside it
is recoverable from that journal. This is not a daemon implementation journal and must not be read as
`<worktree>/.pipeline/events.jsonl`. Unknown additive fields are compatible within schema version 1;
another schema version fails explicitly. Existing BUILD and SHIP event names and files are unchanged.
Generic `run-record` accepts `accepted_result` and `artifact_validation` completion evidence.
`land_reconciliation` is reserved for the engine-owned `land` reconciliation path.

New runs require a permitted readiness projection before `run_started` or any authoring step.
Legacy journals whose creation event predates the readiness field replay without that new gate.
`engineer worktree` records readiness plus the mechanical run-started, routing-selected, and
worktree-created transitions. A host must not emit them again. A managed Codex or other host without structured
Engineer hooks retains the returned `engineerRunId` and uses `run-record` for each authoring
`step_started`, evidence-backed `step_completed`, applicable `step_skipped`, established
`step_failed`, and same-run `step_retried` transition. A retry precedes the next start. A lifecycle
command error stops authoring; it is not safe to continue with unrecorded progress.

The `slug`, `branch`, and `worktreePath` returned beside that run id remain authoritative through
authoring, land, and handoff. The host uses the returned slug for feature-scoped filenames and uses
the marker only to resume the same identity. Land still validates the final artifacts and records
its own refusal or reconciliation, so host guidance neither replaces the deterministic gate nor
duplicates its events.

`--source-ref` on `worktree`, `--body` on `worktree`, and the `--idea` and free-text launch forms are
all accepted by the code but absent from the root `--help` output.

Every subcommand that touches the ledger — `launch`'s pre-poll, `land`, `handoff`, `claim`, `forget`,
`unclaim`, `requeue`, and `resolve` — fails closed on a corrupt ledger: exit 1 with
`engineer <kind>: intake ledger is corrupt at <path>; quarantine path: <path>; ledger was not
modified.` The ledger itself is left untouched for repair. See
[corrupt intake ledger or stuck ledger lease](../runbooks/corrupt-intake-ledger.md).

> **Known limitation.** Omitting a required flag or positional on `worktree`, `land`, `handoff`,
> `forget`, or `resolve` prints the full guide text and exits **0**, not a usage error. A script that

> **Known limitation.** `engineer land --help` states that land pushes the branch and opens the spec

> [#1012](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1012).

## `conduct-ts register`

```bash
conduct-ts register [path]
```

Validates that `path` is an existing git repository, derives `{name = basename, path = absolute,
remote = redacted origin URL}`, and upserts it into the project registry with status `registered`.
`path` defaults to the current directory; a relative path resolves against it, and a leading-`-` token
is never taken as the path.

Prints `Registered <name> (<abs>).` and exits 0. Exits 1 when the path does not exist, is not a git
repository, or the registry write fails. A rejected validation leaves the registry byte-unchanged.

## `conduct-ts create`

```bash
conduct-ts create <name> [--remote <url>]
```

No-clobber scaffold: creates the directory, runs `git init -q`, writes a skeleton `CLAUDE.md`, a
`.gitignore` containing `.pipeline/`, `.daemon/`, and `.worktrees/`, and
`.ai-conductor/config.yml` from `templates/project-config.yml.template`, optionally adds the origin
remote, and upserts the project with status `created`.

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--remote <url>`, `--remote=<url>` | string | — | Adds `origin`. Never pushes. The registry record stores a redacted form of the URL. |

Prints `Created <name> (<target>).` and exits 0. Exits 1 when the target directory is non-empty —
writing nothing — or when the scaffold or registry write fails. Omitting `<name>` falls through to the
inline refusal and exits 1.

## `conduct-ts config init`

```bash
conduct-ts config init
```

Initializes the current Git repository's `.ai-conductor/config.yml` from
`templates/project-config.yml.template`. A first run prints the created path and exits 0. If the
file already exists, it reports that path, preserves the file byte-for-byte, and exits 0.

The command exits 1 without writing when the current directory is not a Git repository or when the
template cannot be resolved or written.

## `conduct-ts config read` / `conduct-ts config write` / `conduct-ts config set`

```bash
conduct-ts config read <dotted.path>
conduct-ts config write <markdown_viewer|mermaid_renderer> <preset> <command> <args> <mode>
conduct-ts config set conductor.<key> <scalar>
```

`read` resolves the effective configuration at `<dotted.path>`. From a directory with a project
`.ai-conductor/config.yml`, it deep-merges user config with project config and lets the project value
win; when there is no project config, it reads user config only. `write` remains user-scoped
`~/.ai-conductor/config.yml` behavior for the markdown viewer and mermaid renderer, while `set`
updates the user-scoped update flow's `conductor:` block.

`read` prints the value at `<dotted.path>` (e.g. `markdown_viewer.command`) to stdout, joining an
array value with spaces, and prints an empty line for a missing key. It exits 1 and prints the
relevant project or user config read error to stdout when parsing fails.

`write` sets `markdown_viewer` or `mermaid_renderer` to `{preset, command, args, mode}` — `<args>`
is a single space-separated argument, split on whitespace — preserving every other top-level key
already in the file. It exits 1 and prints the config path and error to stderr when the existing
file fails to parse or the write fails (e.g. an unwritable directory).

`set` updates exactly one `conductor` key without replacing other user configuration. Supported
keys are `update_channel`, `auto_check`, `current_version`, and `last_checked_at`.
`conductor.auto_check` accepts only `true` or `false` and is stored as a YAML boolean; the other
keys are stored as strings. The command validates both the existing and prospective `conductor:`
block before writing, so invalid channels, unknown keys, malformed user YAML, and write failures
exit 1 without changing the file. Use `config read conductor.<key>` to inspect the stored scalar.

## `conduct-ts task`

```bash
conduct-ts task start <id>
conduct-ts task done <id>
```

Exactly two positionals: the verb and a task id matching `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` (for example `7` or
`rem-fr10-1`). A missing or unknown verb, or a missing id, prints the guide to stderr and exits 2.

`start` reads `.pipeline/task-status.json`, flips the matching row's status to `in_progress`, writes it
back atomically, then writes the id into `.pipeline/current-task`. It exits 1 when the status file is
unreadable, corrupt, not an object, or has no `tasks` array; when the id is not found (the error lists
the valid ids); or when either write fails.

`done` reads `.pipeline/current-task`. An absent stamp exits 0 — the command is idempotent. A stamp
holding a different id prints `cannot clear task <id>; current stamp is <other>` and exits 1 with the
stamp untouched. A match removes the stamp. `done` never modifies `task-status.json`; completion is the
gate authority's decision. See [gates](../explanation/gates.md).

## `conduct-ts test-suite`

```bash
conduct-ts test-suite
```

Runs the aggregate verification gate between BUILD and SHIP against the `test_suite` block in
[configuration](configuration.md). Takes no arguments; any extra argument prints
`Usage: conduct-ts test-suite` plus `Remove extra arguments and rerun. If verification blocks, return
to /tdd or /pipeline before SHIP.` to stderr and exits 1.

| Outcome | Output | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pass | `<status>: full test suite PASS (fingerprint <fp>, duration <n>ms)` on stdout | 0 |
| Fail | `FAILED: full test suite evidence=<reason>[ freshness=<reason>]. <guidance> Return to /tdd or /pipeline, fix the failure, then rerun conduct-ts test-suite.` on stderr | 1 |

Failure reasons and their guidance:

| Reason | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_config` | Declare `test_suite.command` in `.ai-conductor/config.yml`. |
| `invalid_config` | Fix the `test_suite` block in `.ai-conductor/config.yml`. |
| `invalid_input` | Fix the declared test-suite inputs. |
| `unlaunchable` | Make the declared aggregate command launchable. |
| `timeout` | Fix the suite timeout or the command that exceeded it. |
| `signal` | Fix the suite process termination. |
| `nonzero_exit` | Fix the aggregate suite failures. |
| `preflight_failed` | Fix the full-suite preflight failure. |
| `internal_error` | Fix the full-suite verifier failure. |

This command is dispatched before every other detector and sets the process exit code rather than
exiting immediately. It does not appear in `--help`.

## `conduct-ts scoped-run`

```bash
conduct-ts scoped-run <selectors...>
```

Runs the configured scoped test command for one or more selectors. It expands the selectors only at
the `{selectors}` placeholder in `test_suite.scoped_command`; see [configuration](configuration.md).
It does not run the aggregate `test_suite.command` or create, replace, or reuse aggregate verification
evidence.

The command runs in `test_suite.working_directory` (project root when unset), the same directory the
aggregate `test_suite.command` runs in. Selectors are named the way the repository names them —
relative to the project root — and a selector that only resolves from the root is rebased onto the
working directory before expansion. A selector that already resolves from the working directory, an
absolute path, a flag (leading `-`), and a non-path name pattern all pass through unchanged.

At least one non-blank selector is required. An empty selection exits 1 and directs the caller to the
shared aggregate verifier. If `test_suite.scoped_command` is not configured, it exits 1 without falling
back to the aggregate command. A selected-test failure returns that command's nonzero exit code; a
successful selected run exits 0. This command does not appear in `--help`.

## `conduct-ts shipped-record`

```bash
conduct-ts shipped-record --slug <slug> --pr <url|local>
```

Writes and commits `.docs/shipped/<slug>.md` on the current branch. Run it in the feature worktree, on
the implementation branch, before the final push, so the merge that lands the code atomically lands the
fact that the spec shipped and the daemon stops re-dispatching it. Never run it for a `keep` or
`discard` finish — nothing shipped, so there is no record.

| Flag | Type | Required | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--slug <slug>` | string | yes | The plan stem to record. |
| `--pr <url\|local>` | string | yes | The PR URL, or the literal `local` for a merge-local finish. |

It resolves the plan identity, hashes `.docs/plans/<slug>.md` and its stories file — the plan's
`**Stories:**` reference first, then `.docs/stories/<slug>.md` — renders the record with a cost block
when one can be computed, then `git add`s the file and commits it as `shipped record: <slug>` only when
the staged content actually changed. Identical already-committed content produces no duplicate commit.

It also appends a `## Time` block computed independently from `.pipeline/events.jsonl`, reporting
`state: measured|partial|unavailable` with `active_ms`, `provider_active_ms`, and
`no_provider_active_ms` when measured. A `partial` block adds `reason: <route>` when the rollup
identifies its downgrade route; records shipped before this field existed simply omit the line. A
missing or corrupt event ledger, or any timing-computation failure, never blocks the Cost block or the
commit — the record ships with `state: unavailable` instead.

The frontmatter also carries `engine_version`: the engine build id that shipped the feature — the same
value `conduct-ts daemon status` prints as `version:<id>`. It is resolved from the running engine's own
module path, so a published build records e.g. `20260727T234833Z-b5b34bb9f015` and an unpublished
source checkout records `dev`. Resolution never throws and never blocks the record. Records written
before this field existed simply omit the line, and `conduct-ts kpi` reports those as
`engine=unknown`.

Either flag missing prints the usage guide to stderr and exits 1.

Success is reported on **stdout** (`✓ shipped record committed: <path>`, or
`✓ shipped record already committed: <path>` on an idempotent re-run); only failures — the usage
guide, a degraded cost or timing rollup, and the write-failed warning — go to stderr. The daemon
calls this command in-process and tees `console.error` into `.daemon/daemon.log` tagged `[error]`,
so a success line on stderr would make every completed ship read as a failure.

Every other failure exits **0** with one warning and no record written, so the exit code cannot be
used to detect success. See
[shipped-record reconciliation](../runbooks/shipped-record-reconciliation.md#recovery).

Does not appear in `--help`.

## `conduct-ts kpi`

```bash
conduct-ts kpi
```

Read-only report over the cost blocks in committed `.docs/shipped/*.md` records. Accepts and ignores
any trailing arguments. Always exits 0: a missing or empty `.docs/shipped` prints a friendly message
rather than an error, and malformed records do not throw. Does not appear in `--help`.

Each per-feature row carries `engine=<id>`, the engine build that shipped it, so ships can be
attributed to a daemon build. A record written before engine-version stamping reports
`engine=unknown` rather than omitting the field, keeping unattributed ships visible in the report.
Rows also show token, cache, dispatch, retry, halt, duration, and cost totals. Cost-unmetered
dispatches are marked `COST-PARTIAL`, retain their tokens, and render their cost as unavailable;
truly unmetered dispatches remain excluded from both aggregates. Provider rows attribute tokens,
cost, cost-unmetered dispatches, and dispatch counts by provider.

Each row also reports engine-observed execution time, parsed from the record's `## Time` block
independently of Cost: `time=measured active_ms=<n> provider_active_ms=<n> no_provider_active_ms=<n>`
splits durable feature wall-clock time into time spent inside a provider process versus engine/code
time; `time=partial` (optionally with `active_ms`) adds `reason=<route>` when the rollup identifies
the downgrade route: `empty-active-union`, `active-evidence-incomplete`,
`open-executions:<ids>`, `provider-outside-active-union`, or `provider-evidence-incomplete`.
Records shipped before the reason field existed simply omit it and report `time=partial` without a
route. `time=unavailable` marks evidence that could not be trusted, and a record with no `## Time`
block — including every record shipped before this section existed — reports `time=unavailable`.
The aggregate line adds `timing measured=<n> partial=<n> unavailable=<n>` counts and
`avg_active_ms`/`avg_provider_active_ms`/`avg_no_provider_active_ms`, averaged only over measured
features.

## `conduct-ts memory setup`

```bash
conduct-ts memory setup [dir]
```

Prepares the memory store for a project. `dir` defaults to the current directory; a relative path
resolves against it.

| Existing `.memory/` | Action |
| --- | --- |
| A real directory | Copy-verify-swap migration, logging `conduct memory setup: migrating existing .memory/ in <dir>` |
| Absent, or already a symlink | Creates the canonical store and symlink; idempotent |

Prints `conduct memory setup: .memory/ is ready at <dir>` and exits 0. Exits 1 when the directory does
not exist or anything throws. Only the exact two-token form `memory setup` matches. Does not appear in
`--help`.

## `conduct-ts halt-issues sweep`

```bash
conduct-ts halt-issues sweep --repo-dir <dir> --gh-repo <owner/name>
                             [--monitor-log <path>] [--ledger <path>] [--dry-run]
```

Parses the halt monitor log, loads or rebuilds the ledger, stamps, resolves, or closes each entry
against the issue tracker, writes the ledger atomically, and prints a summary.

| Flag | Type | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--repo-dir <dir>` | path | yes | — |
| `--gh-repo <owner/name>` | string | yes | — |
| `--monitor-log <path>` | path | no | `~/.ai-conductor/halt-monitor/monitor.log` |
| `--ledger <path>` | path | no | `~/.ai-conductor/halt-issues/ledger.json` |
| `--dry-run` | boolean | no | `false` — with it, the ledger is not written |

`--help` or `-h` prints usage to stdout and exits 0. A missing required flag or any unrecognized
`--flag` prints usage to stderr and exits 1 — a misused subcommand never falls through to the pipeline
launcher. Otherwise the exit code is the sweep's own; an unrecoverable error prints `halt-issues sweep
failed: <msg>` and exits 1. Requires network access through `gh`.

## `conduct-ts overlap-scan`

```bash
conduct-ts overlap-scan [--files <a.ts,b.ts>] [--source-ref <owner/repo#N>] [--base <ref>] [--cwd <dir>]
```

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--files <list>` | comma-separated paths | none | Candidate paths. Split on commas, trimmed, empties dropped. |
| `--source-ref <ref>` | string | unset | Linked issue reference swept for open blockers. |
| `--base <ref>` | string | the origin default branch, else `main` | Base branch that sibling branches are diffed against. |
| `--cwd <dir>` | path | current directory | Repository to scan. |

Advisory by contract: it always exits 0. Even an unexpected error prints `overlap-scan: unable to
complete scan (<msg>)` and still returns 0. Reads git and queries `gh`; writes nothing.

## `conduct-ts plan-protected-targets`

```bash
conduct-ts plan-protected-targets .docs/plans/<feature>.md
```

Blocking plan-authoring check for tasks that name another feature's artifact under
`.docs/architecture/`, `.docs/decisions/`, `.docs/plans/`, `.docs/specs/`, or `.docs/stories/`. It reads
the named plan, resolves each task's `**Files:**` set (including `same` inheritance), and writes
nothing. Own-feature paths and unsealed `.docs/` paths pass.

Every task's prose is also scanned, whether or not it has a `**Files:**` line: a protected artifact
cited in a backtick path (e.g. `` `.docs/specs/other-feature.md` ``) is reported alongside any
declared `**Files:**` violation, since a `**Files:**` declaration does not resolve a foreign
protected reference elsewhere in the task.

| Outcome | Output | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No violations | `No protected-target violations found.` | 0 |
| Violation | One line per offending path: `Task <id>: <path> — return this amendment to DECIDE; BUILD tasks must not target protected artifacts.` | 1 |

Run it before committing a plan. Correct the accepted artifact during DECIDE and re-author the task;
do not hand the amendment to BUILD. The land gate repeats this check when a spec is landed.

## `conduct-ts decide-grant`

```bash
conduct-ts decide-grant --slug <slug> --step <step> --reason "<operator direction>"
```

Records one explicit authorization for an autonomous run to enter a named DECIDE step. Run it from the
main repository checkout. It writes `.daemon/grants/<slug>.json`; the daemon never creates this
artifact itself.

The grant lives in the daemon-owned `.daemon/` directory, **outside every feature worktree**, and
that placement is the authorization boundary. It previously lived at
`.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/decide-grant.json` — inside the directory a build agent writes all build
long — so the subject of the authorization could write its own permission slip. A
`decide-grant.json` inside a worktree authorizes nothing.

| Flag | Required | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--slug <slug>` | yes | Feature worktree slug. A slash, `.` or `..` is rejected. |
| `--step <step>` | yes | Exact DECIDE step to authorize. The grant does not authorize any other step. `plan` is rejected — see below. |
| `--reason <reason>` | yes | Operator's reason for allowing this one DECIDE entry. |

**`plan` can never be granted.** The command exits non-zero when `--step plan` is passed, and the
entry policy refuses `plan` before it consults a grant at all, so no grant of any provenance admits
it. A daemon that re-plans rewrites an approved DECIDE artifact with no human at the gate — the same
class of failure the re-entry was meant to repair. Drive the plan revision interactively, then resume
the feature.

The matching grant is consumed immediately before the provider dispatches the named step. A stale,
malformed, mismatched, or already-consumed grant authorizes nothing and the run remains fail-closed.
Clearing `.pipeline/HALT` or `.pipeline/HALT.class` is not an authorization; use the
[DECIDE-entry recovery procedure](../runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md#the-halt-refused-a-decide-entry).

## `conduct-ts rewind`

```bash
conduct-ts rewind --to <step>
```

Returns a halted feature to an earlier pipeline step. Run it from that feature's worktree, for example
`cd .worktrees/<slug>`, after identifying the step that must run again.

`--to` is required and must name a step in the resolved registry that is strictly earlier than the
feature's recorded `last_step`. The command refuses an unknown, current, or later target without
mutating state. It also refuses if the state changed while the rewind was being applied.

On success, it marks the target and every later non-skipped step `stale`, clears their gate verdicts,
then clears both `.pipeline/HALT` and `.pipeline/HALT.class` atomically. It emits an `operator_rewind`
event and prints `Rewound to <step>.` The next daemon dispatch begins at the rewound step. Do not edit
`conduct-state.json`, gate files, or halt markers by hand; use this command instead.

## `conduct-ts reseal`

```bash
conduct-ts reseal --slug <slug> --path <path> [--path <path> ...] --reason "<rationale>" [--clear-halt]
```

Re-fingerprints named protected DECIDE artifacts against the current commit after an operator has
reviewed and approved an amendment committed after first BUILD entry — the audited alternative to
hand-editing `.pipeline/protected-artifact-seal.json`. Run it from the main repository checkout, not
from inside the feature worktree.

| Flag | Required | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--slug <slug>` | yes | Feature worktree slug (`.worktrees/<slug>`). A slash, `.`, or `..` is rejected. |
| `--path <path>` | yes, repeatable | A protected artifact path to reseal. Every occurrence reseals one more path; at least one is required. |
| `--reason <reason>` | yes | Operator rationale for the reseal. A missing or blank rationale is refused and audited. |
| `--clear-halt` | no | Also clear a resolved protected-artifact HALT in the worktree after resealing. |

**Interactive-operator only.** The command refuses with `requires an interactive terminal` unless
`process.stdin.isTTY` is true, so it cannot be reached from a `build`/`SHIP` step subprocess, an
autonomous provider session, or a script piping stdin — only a human at a terminal can reseal.

**Scoped, not a full rebaseline.** Only the listed paths are re-fingerprinted; every other protected
path must still match its existing baseline or the whole reseal is refused — an operator cannot use
`--path` to launder unrelated drift into the seal. Each listed path must already be protected and
sealed, resolvable at the current commit, not deleted, and free of uncommitted changes (commit the
amendment first). Refusal conditions — unknown worktree, missing rationale, non-interactive terminal,
missing seal, an unlisted-path violation, or an invalid reseal target — are each written to the audit
trail as `protected_artifact_reseal_refused` before the command exits 1; a successful reseal writes
`protected_artifact_reseal` with the resealed paths' prior and new fingerprints. Both are audited with
an `operator` origin, distinct from step-attributed records. See
[artifacts](artifacts.md#write-guards) for the seal format and
[the stalled-feature runbook](../runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md#the-halt-is-a-protected-artifact-violation)
for the full recovery procedure.

The `--reason` rationale is not just an audit-trail entry: the next `build_review` on this feature
renders every `operator-reseal`-triggered entry, with its paths, rationale, and commit range, in the
grader's prompt as evidence to judge — see
[operator-authorized protected-artifact reseals](../explanation/gates.md#operator-authorized-protected-artifact-reseals).

On success the command prints `Resealed protected artifacts: <paths>` and exits 0. With
`--clear-halt`, it additionally clears the worktree's `HALT`/`HALT.class` markers when a halt is
present and its class is the protected-artifact class, and reports the outcome (`No halt to clear.`,
or why a present halt was not cleared) on a second line.

## `conduct-ts evidence`

```bash
conduct-ts evidence
```

The `evidence judge` gate was removed — per-task commit stamping is telemetry, not a gate, and
citation-quality sampling now runs as a non-blocking spot audit. The command survives only so the token
resolves to a clear message instead of an unrecognized-command error. Any argument form prints the
retirement notice and exits **2**. The help string does not mention the non-zero exit.

## `conduct-ts closeout-event`

```bash
conduct-ts closeout-event <obligation> <started-at> <ended-at>
```

Records one pipeline closeout timing event. `<obligation>` must be one of `evaluator`,
`simplify`, `architecture-diagram`, `micro-retro`, `memory`, `summary`; `<started-at>` and
`<ended-at>` are millisecond epoch timestamps. An unrecognized obligation prints the valid list
to stderr and exits 1; otherwise it appends a `pipeline_closeout` event to the pipeline-owned
sibling ledger, `.pipeline/pipeline-events.jsonl`, and exits 0.

This command is called by a closeout obligation itself (for example the `evaluator` gate in the
[pipeline skill](skills.md)), not typed by an operator, so it never starts a
conductor or daemon and works identically whether `pipeline` is running under the engine or
invoked inline in a bare session. The sibling ledger is a separate single-writer file from
`.pipeline/events.jsonl` — when a `build` step is running under the engine, a tail reader
re-emits each recorded event onto the live bus for the daemon log, terminal UI, and OTel export,
but `pipeline_closeout` is never persisted a second time into `.pipeline/events.jsonl`.

## `conduct-ts build-tail`

```bash
conduct-ts build-tail [worktree]
```

Renders a read-only task/remediation/closeout timing rollup for one `build` step, decomposing
its single opaque provider session into task execution, kickback remediation, and closeout
ceremony. `[worktree]` defaults to the current working directory. Always exits 0.

The rollup reads and merges the engine ledger (`.pipeline/events.jsonl`) and the pipeline-owned
sibling ledger (`.pipeline/pipeline-events.jsonl`) for the given worktree, and reports one of
three states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `measured` | At least one complete `build` window (`step_started`/`step_completed`) was decomposed. Reports, per window, its classification (`first-pass` or `re-entry`), task execution duration, post-resolution tick counts split into remediation and closeout, and closeout duration with a per-obligation breakdown — plus an aggregate across all windows. |
| `partial` | The ledgers are readable but a window is unterminated, malformed, or an inline pipeline run (no engine) produced closeout events with no engine window boundaries. When closeout events exist, the closeout-only timeline is still rendered. |
| `unavailable` | No `build` window and no closeout events were found. |

A window's first tick determines its classification: if it already reads `resolved == total`,
the window is a re-entry (the task graph was complete on entry); otherwise its task-execution
segment ends at the first tick where `resolved == total`. Post-resolution ticks with
`headMoved: true` classify as remediation; closeout classification comes from the merged
`pipeline_closeout` timeline. See `.docs/architecture/build-post-task-tail-telemetry.md` for the
full model.

## Internal commands, invoked by the engine

These are dispatched by skills, hooks, and the daemon rather than typed by an operator. None appear in
`--help`. They are listed so a name found in a log or a hook script is findable.

| Command | Syntax | Purpose | Exit codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `intake-loop` | `conduct-ts intake-loop --continuous \| --once [--interval-ms <n>]` | Polls registered repos into the durable inbox, notifies through the status surface, and reconciles closed GitHub issues each tick so a closed issue cannot be re-claimed. Never spawns a provider session and never opens a PR. `--interval-ms` defaults to 300000. Exactly one of `--continuous` and `--once` is required. | 0 on completion; 1 for the usage guide |
| `brain start\|stop\|status` | `conduct-ts brain <verb>` | Host-wide singleton that hosts `conduct-ts intake-loop --continuous` in the tmux session `cc-brain-conductor`. `start` is idempotent; `status` prints `brain loop: running\|stopped` and a queued count. | 0; 1 on a tmux error |
| `render-diagrams` | `conduct-ts render-diagrams <file.md>… [--check]` | Renders the Mermaid blocks in each file using the configured `mermaid_renderer` preset. `--check` parse-checks blocks without opening them. | Default mode always 0. `--check`: 1 when any block fails to parse or a file is unreadable; 0 when everything parses, there are no diagrams, or `mmdc` is unavailable. Zero files: 1 |
| `rate-card` | `conduct-ts rate-card refresh [--model <id>]…` · `conduct-ts rate-card show` | Maintains `<project>/.ai-conductor/rate-card.json`, the committed per-model token price card the harness prices dispatches from for providers that report token counts but no cost (codex). `refresh` fetches LiteLLM's public `model_prices_and_context_window.json`, prunes it to the models the provider model policies route to (plus any `--model`), and rewrites the card with a fresh `as_of`; commit the result. `--model` is repeatable. `show` prints the committed card. The fetch lives here, never on the dispatch path. `.github/workflows/rate-card-refresh.yml` runs `refresh` daily and opens a bot PR on the `automation/rate-card` branch when the published rates actually change — a run that finds identical rates discards its own `as_of`-only diff and opens nothing. A failed fetch, an unparseable payload, or a payload pricing none of the routed models leaves the committed card byte-for-byte unchanged. | 0 on success; 1 for the usage guide, a failed refresh, or a missing/unreadable card under `show` |
| `shipment-evidence` | `conduct-ts shipment-evidence --pr <url> [--event <path>]` · `shipment-evidence reconcile --pr <url> --shipped <YYYY-MM-DD>` · `shipment-evidence audit [--report <path>]` | Classifies, repairs, or audits the association between a PR and its shipped record. `audit` is report-only and never writes records. `reconcile` requires `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`. | check: 0 valid or not-applicable association, 1 otherwise. reconcile: 0 unless unresolved. audit: 0. Malformed: 1 |
| `finish-record` | `conduct-ts finish-record --choice <pr\|keep> [--pr-url <url>] --pipeline-dir <dir>` | Records the finish choice. `--choice pr` requires `--pr-url`; `--choice keep` must not carry one; `discard` is not accepted. `--pipeline-dir` must be an absolute path to an existing directory, checked before any spawn or write. The `pr` path is fail-closed across seven checks — PR binding, upstream push, state readability, branch shape (`spec/<slug>`, `feature/<slug>`, or the daemon's `feat/daemon-<slug>` — a bare `feat/<name>` is refused), slug derivability, `git rev-parse HEAD`, and a valid shipment-evidence verdict. | 0; 1 on any guide or failed check |
| `manual-test-record` | `conduct-ts manual-test-record --skip --reason <r> --pipeline-dir <dir>` · `conduct-ts manual-test-record --results <path\|-> --pipeline-dir <dir>` | Appends a `## Attempt N` section to `<pipelineDir>/manual-test-results.md`, atomically. `--results -` reads stdin; an exact `WARN` result cell stamps the attempt with `<!-- manual-test:warning -->`. `--skip` and `--results` are mutually exclusive and one is required. `--pipeline-dir` must be absolute. | 0; 1 on a usage error, an empty results payload, or any read/write error |
| `derive-feedback` | `conduct-ts derive-feedback --sha <sha> [--plan <path>]` | Read-only advisory check for whether commit `<sha>` carries `Task: <id>` evidence, or touches files declared under a task in the given plan. Prints one JSON line. Never writes task status or the evidence sidecar. | **0 evidenced, 1 not evidenced, 2 usage.** Informational only — the calling hook must not propagate them |
| `build-auth-status` | `conduct-ts build-auth-status` | Reports the self-host build auth mode and token state as `build-auth-status: mode=<mode> state=<state>[ path=<path>][ (<detail>)]`. Probes the real dispatch auth path when a token is present. | 0 when the mode is not `daemon-token` (`state=api-key`) or the token is `valid`; 1 for `missing`, `unreadable`, `invalid`, or `unverifiable`, each with a remediation message |
