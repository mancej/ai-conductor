# Steps

The complete step vocabulary the engine executes: names, order, phase, enforcement, skip rules,
artifacts, and the skill each step dispatches. These names are what `ai-conductor inline --from <step>` accepts.

There are 24 step names: 20 sequential steps in `ALL_STEPS` and 4 out-of-band steps in
`OUT_OF_BAND_STEPS`. `validation` and `build_verification` are step *groups* wrapping existing steps,
not steps themselves — neither can be passed to `--from`.

Tables on this page are source-ordered (the order of `ALL_STEPS`), not alphabetized. The order of that
array *is* the flow.

## Enforcement levels

Enforcement is a property of the engine's step definition, not of the skill's frontmatter. It decides
whether the step can be skipped and whether it can be disabled by config.

| Level | Can be skipped | Can be config-disabled | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `advisory` | Yes | Yes | `memory`, `explore`, `complexity`, `architecture_diagram`, `architecture_review`, and all four out-of-band steps |
| `gating` | No | Only with `configDisableAllowed` | `prd`, `stories`, `conflict_check`, `plan`, `coherence_check`, `acceptance_specs`, `build_review`, `test_suite`, `manual_test`, `prd_audit`, `architecture_review_as_built`, `finish` |
| `structural` | No | Never — the flag is ignored entirely | `worktree`, `build`, `rebase` |
| `mechanical` | — | — | Nothing. The level is declared in the type union but no step definition uses it. |

Skippability is exactly `enforcement !== 'gating'`. Tier and track skips (below) are a separate
mechanism and apply to gating steps too. For what a gate *is* and why it fails closed, see
[gates](../explanation/gates.md).

## Sequential steps

The 20 steps of `ALL_STEPS`, in execution order. "Skips" lists tier and track exclusions; see
[Tier skips](#tier-skips) and [Track skips](#track-skips).

| # | Step | Phase | Enforcement | Prerequisites | Skips | Dispatches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `worktree` | SETUP | structural | — | — | `/conduct worktree` |
| 1 | `memory` | UNDERSTAND | advisory | — | — | `/memory` |
| 2 | `explore` | DECIDE | advisory | — | — | `/explore` |
| 3 | `complexity` | DECIDE | advisory | `explore` | — | `/conduct complexity` |
| 4 | `prd` | DECIDE | gating | `explore` | track `technical` | `/prd` |
| 5 | `architecture_diagram` | DECIDE | advisory | `complexity` | tier S | `/architecture-diagram` |
| 6 | `architecture_review` | DECIDE | advisory | `architecture_diagram` | tier S | `/architecture-review` |
| 7 | `stories` | DECIDE | gating | `architecture_review` | — | `/stories` |
| 8 | `conflict_check` | DECIDE | gating | `stories` | tier S | `/conflict-check` |
| 9 | `plan` | DECIDE | gating | `conflict_check` | — | `/plan` |
| 10 | `coherence_check` | DECIDE | gating | `plan` | tier S | `/coherence-check` |
| 11 | `acceptance_specs` | BUILD | gating | `plan` | tier S | `/writing-system-tests` |
| 12 | `build` | BUILD | structural | `plan` | — | `/pipeline` |
| 13 | `test_suite` | BUILD | gating | `build` | — | engine-native |
| 14 | `build_review` | BUILD | gating | `test_suite` | — | engine-native |
| 15 | `manual_test` | SHIP | gating | `test_suite` | tier S | `/manual-test` |
| 16 | `prd_audit` | SHIP | gating | `manual_test` | — (runs at every tier and on both tracks; trivially passes when a feature has no acceptance criteria to grade) | `/prd-audit` |
| 17 | `architecture_review_as_built` | SHIP | gating | `prd_audit` | — (runs at every tier; individual checks are conditional on tier and artifact presence, see [gates](../explanation/gates.md#the-as-built-architecture-reviews-checks-and-verdict)) | `/architecture-review --as-built` |
| 18 | `rebase` | SHIP | structural | `architecture_review_as_built` | — | native; `/rebase` only on conflict |
| 19 | `finish` | SHIP | gating | `rebase` | — | `/finish` |

Per phase: SETUP 1, UNDERSTAND 1, DECIDE 9, BUILD 4, SHIP 5.

### Engineer authoring lifecycle steps

The interactive Engineer run is separate from the later implementation run, but it uses the same
canonical names for authoring progress: `bootstrap`, `memory`, `assess`, `explore`, `complexity`,
`prd`, `architecture_diagram`, `architecture_review`, `stories`, `conflict_check`, `plan`, and
`coherence_check`. These names appear on `engineer_step_*` events and are validated by
`engineer run-record`; arbitrary names are refused.

Step attempts are local to one Engineer run and one step. A retry increments `stepAttempt` and appends
history instead of overwriting it. Run retries are different: after cancellation, failure, or settlement,
a new attempt key creates a successor `engineerRunId` with its own revision cursor and a predecessor
link. Terminal runs never reopen.

Land is the completion authority for DECIDE. It reconciles product versus technical track and the S/M/L
skip rules from validated, idea-scoped artifacts. It can append missing `completed` or `skipped` events
with `completion: land_reconciliation`, but it refuses a contradiction with already recorded state.
This authoring stream does not change `ALL_STEPS`, `conduct-state.json`, or any BUILD/SHIP status.

`test_suite` is the sole engine-native BUILD verifier. Static wiring reachability is retired.
`build_review` currently runs only its optional `testQuality` rubric. The engine freezes the base/HEAD
source and active feature artifacts, then derives established test regions and concrete uncertain
candidates from changed declarations, current-feature-owned `Covers` bindings introduced or updated
after the review base, and relevant shared setup or helper evidence. An unchanged bare marker remains
owned by the feature that landed it; a coincidentally matching active-plan ordinal cannot make it
current authority. The engine does not make every title in a changed marked file a review target. A candidate's
file can be selected for conservative counterfactual execution without making unchanged sibling tests
quality targets.

An enabled rubric with no established targets or concrete candidates is a valid empty-scope PASS: it does
not dispatch the reviewer or counterfactual preflight. This preserves production-only refactors and pure
moves/renames as non-coverage work; the aggregate suite and CI remain responsible for broad regression
execution. For each concrete candidate, the normal reviewer returns one source-bound scope resolution:
`resolved`, `out-of-scope`, or `indeterminate`. An indeterminate candidate preserves any otherwise valid
findings but creates a derived `scope-incomplete` fault. It follows the existing bounded mechanical-fault
and explicit reduced-coverage recovery path rather than inventing a test-insensitive finding or silently
passing. See [stalled or stuck feature](../runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md#build_review-has-a-scope-incomplete-candidate).

### Retiring a step safely

Step retirement has two phases: first remove the step's machinery while retaining its name as a
deprecated no-op; only in a later, separate change may the name be deleted, after no live state or
consumer configuration can reference it. This preserves in-flight `conduct-state.json`, configured
step keys, historical artifacts, and downstream prerequisites while operators receive an observable
deprecation notice. See `adr-2026-08-11-deprecated-no-op-step-retirement`.

Two steps are checkpoints (`isCheckpoint: true`) — the engine pauses for the operator after them in
default and interactive mode: `build` and `manual_test`.

`build` is the first `loopGate` step, which makes index 12 the boundary between the front (DECIDE-ish,
one-way) region and the gate loop. Everything from `build` to `finish` is a loop gate and can be
re-entered when a downstream gate kicks back. The kickback targets — the steps a blocking gate can send
work back to — are `prd`, `architecture_review`, `stories`, and `plan`.

## Repository-local self-host tail

This repository adds two configured SHIP gates without changing the static `ALL_STEPS` index:
`rebase → maintain-documentation → release-disposition → finish`. `release-disposition` is gating,
writes the authoritative structured metadata to the retained SHIP draft PR, and records only its
completion evidence in `.pipeline/release-disposition-pass`. The later `finish` step preserves that
metadata while supplying the reader-facing PR body.

`finish` captures the exact metadata block before it dispatches and restores it after the prose
author has rewritten the body. Because `finish` advances one publication transition per dispatch,
that capture is taken **once** per retained PR and persisted to
`.pipeline/release-metadata-snapshot.json`: a later dispatch — including one in a fresh process after
a daemon re-dispatch — reuses it instead of re-reading a body the prose author has already replaced.
Dispatching `release-disposition` discards the capture, so a kickback that rewrites the disposition
never has its superseded block restored over the new one.

Both configured gates read the **retained SHIP PR**, which the engine adopts at SHIP-phase entry. If
that PR is a reused `needs-remediation` halt placeholder, the engine makes it presentable whenever
that identity is resolved — at adoption, at the pre-finish snapshot, or at the finish-time
restore — so a SHIP step scheduled ahead of `finish` never reads a remediation placeholder. A
lighter clear also runs once at the start of every dispatch, regardless of phase, so a resumed
`BUILD` step is not left holding the placeholder either. The draft→ready flip remains finish-only.
See [running the daemon](../guides/running-the-daemon.md#a-reused-halt-pr-is-made-presentable-at-resolution-and-at-the-dispatch-boundary-not-only-at-finish).

## Out-of-band steps

These have full step definitions and are dispatchable, but hold no slot in the sequential loop.
`--from` cannot start at them; the engine invokes them itself when a condition fires.

| Step | Phase | Enforcement | Prerequisites | Dispatches | When it runs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bootstrap` | UNDERSTAND | advisory | — | `/bootstrap` | Prelude, before the loop |
| `assess` | UNDERSTAND | advisory | — | `/assess` | Prelude; short-circuited when `bootstrap_mode` is `new` |
| `remediate` | SHIP | advisory | `prd_audit` | `/remediate` | When a SHIP gate blocks (a `prd_audit` `FIXABLE` grade or the as-built review's `BLOCKED` verdict), or on a build stall |
| `attribution_verify` | SHIP | advisory | — | engine-native | Out-of-band commit-attribution audit |

They exist as definitions because `getStepDefinition` throws `Unknown step: <name>` without one, and
the daemon turns that throw into a `.pipeline/HALT`. Config-declared custom steps resolve from a third
table that `buildStepRegistry` populates, consulted after these two — see
[configuration](configuration.md#custom-step-registry-contract).

## The validation group

`validation` is a `StepGroup` over three members already present in `ALL_STEPS`, in this order:
`manual_test`, `prd_audit`, `architecture_review_as_built`. It does not remove, replace, or reorder
them, and it does not change their state keys.

The group only fans out when all of these hold:

1. The step belongs to a group.
2. The run mode is `auto`. Interactive and default mode never engage the group.
3. The entry step's own prerequisite gate passes.
4. More than one member is dispatchable. A width-1 group degrades silently to the serial path.

Fan-out width is capped by the `validation_concurrency` config key (default 4, which covers the
three-member group in a single wave; see
[configuration](configuration.md)). Branches never write `conduct-state.json` or `.pipeline/gates/*` —
only the loop thread does, after every branch settles.

## The build verification group

`test_suite` is the sole BUILD verifier. It runs after `build` and before `build_review`. After a
BUILD repair, it reuses a matching content fingerprint or derives a fresh suite result. Reuse does
not consume retry or kickback budget.

## Tier skips

Tier S skips 6 steps. Tiers M and L skip none.

| Tier | Steps skipped |
| --- | --- |
| S | `architecture_diagram`, `architecture_review`, `conflict_check`, `coherence_check`, `acceptance_specs`, `manual_test` |
| M | none |
| L | none |

Tier S additionally disengages the land-time coherence gate entirely.

Steps that are **not** tier-skippable at any tier include the whole BUILD spine — `build`,
`build_review`, `test_suite` — plus `plan`, `stories`, `prd`, `rebase`, `finish`,
`prd_audit`, and `architecture_review_as_built`. The latter two used to tier-skip at S; they now run at
every tier, with only their individual checks (as-built) or applicability (whether any acceptance
criterion changed, `prd_audit`) conditional — see [gates](../explanation/gates.md#the-as-built-architecture-reviews-checks-and-verdict).

A skipped step is marked `skipped`, which satisfies downstream prerequisites. The chain never breaks
because of a skip.

## Where the tier comes from

Three separate paths resolve a feature's tier, and each has its own fallback. They are not
reconciled with one another — the path in play decides which fallback you get.

| Path | Where the tier is read | When no tier is found |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daemon dispatch | `.docs/complexity/<slug>.md` on the base-branch tree, via the `Tier: <S\|M\|L>` line; a dated slug falls back once to the date-stripped stem when that stem is unambiguous | `M` — the daemon's own fallback for an absent or garbled marker, logged once per slug with the paths tried |
| `ai-conductor inline --interactive`, and the default run mode | The persisted tier, else the `complexity` step's assessment, confirmed by the operator | `L`, when the assessment fails and there is no prompt to fall back on |

The marker file is the only durable carrier. A tier chosen in an interactive run reaches a later
daemon build only if the `complexity` step committed `.docs/complexity/<slug>.md` under the plan stem —
or under its date-stripped form, the one relaxation the daemon allows
([undated-stem fallback](artifacts.md#the-undated-stem-fallback)) — because that file is the only thing
the daemon looks at. To pin a tier for a daemon build, commit the marker. See
[artifacts](artifacts.md) for the marker's format.

## Track skips

The track split touches exactly one step plus one land-gate layer.

| Difference | `product` | `technical` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prd` (index 4) | Runs | Skipped — no product requirements to spec |
| `prd_audit` (index 17) | Runs — stories' acceptance criteria are the audit key on both tracks; PRD FRs are context only when a PRD exists | Runs |
| Land-time coherence `fr` layer | Required | Not required; the layer degrades away |

Everything else is identical on both tracks. The track is decided in `explore` and recorded in
`.docs/track/<slug>.md`, which the daemon reads with the same
[undated-stem fallback](artifacts.md#the-undated-stem-fallback) as the tier marker. A missing track
resolves to `product`, so nothing is track-skipped when the track is unknown.

## Other skip mechanisms

| Mechanism | Rule | Steps affected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skipWhenSkipped` | Skip when a named upstream step ended `skipped`, for any reason | The mechanism (`shouldSkipForUpstreamSkip`) still exists but no current step definition declares it — `architecture_review_as_built` dropped its use when it stopped mirroring `architecture_review`'s tier-S skip |
| Bootstrap mode | `bootstrap_mode: new` skips the step with a `mode_skip` event | `assess` only |
| `configDisableAllowed` | Opt-in to `steps.<name>.disable: true`. Config validation rejects disabling any other gating or structural built-in | `manual_test` only |
| `when:` | Per-step conditional expression in config. It has the same authority boundary as config disable: advisory steps and the opted-in built-in are allowed; other gating and structural steps are rejected | Advisory steps and `manual_test` |

## Step artifacts and gate behavior

Each step's completion gate reads evidence from disk. The engine recomputes verdicts from that
evidence rather than trusting an agent's self-report. Committed artifacts live under `.docs/`;
uncommitted run evidence lives under `.pipeline/`. See [artifacts](artifacts.md) for file-by-file
detail.

| Step | Evidence | Committed | What satisfies the gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `worktree` | — | — | Prerequisites only; no artifact check |
| `memory` | — | — | Prerequisites only |
| `explore` | — | — | Prerequisites only. Notes are ephemeral; the track marker is written but is not a completion glob |
| `complexity` | — | — | Prerequisites only |
| `prd` | `.docs/specs/*.md` | yes | At least one matching file |
| `architecture_diagram` | `.docs/architecture/*.md` | yes | At least one matching file |
| `architecture_review` | `.docs/decisions/architecture-review-*.md`, `.docs/decisions/adr-*.md` | yes | At least one matching file |
| `stories` | `.docs/stories/**/*.md` | yes | At least one matching file. The verdict layer additionally requires this feature's stories doc to carry `### Happy Path` and `### Negative Path(s)` sections, each with at least one Given/When/Then bullet, and no `Status: DRAFT` |
| `conflict_check` | `.docs/conflicts/*.md` | yes | At least one matching file |
| `plan` | `.docs/plans/*.md` | yes | At least one matching file. The verdict layer additionally requires every story unit in this feature's plan to be covered by at least one task, and fails when the feature's plan cannot be resolved among several |
| `coherence_check` | `.docs/coherence/*.md` | yes | At least one matching file, named with the plan's filename stem |
| `acceptance_specs` | spec files in the project's test dirs, plus `.pipeline/acceptance-specs-red.json` | specs yes, evidence no | At least one spec file **and** RED evidence proving the feature's own specs ran and failed. A spec that was skipped, deselected, or hit a collection error does not establish RED |
| `build` | `.pipeline/task-status.json` | no | No `.pipeline/halt-user-input-required` marker, every task completed or skipped, **and** a clean working tree whenever the status probe establishes one. The post-rebase closure applies the same conjunct: a reapplied autostash blocks BUILD until the named paths are committed or discarded. An absent or failed probe fails open to the legacy behavior. Task status is re-seeded and re-derived on each evaluation, so forged rows fail |
| `build_review` | `.pipeline/build-review.json` | no | A fresh, valid effective `PASS` from the enabled rubric set (currently only `testQuality`, off by default — an empty enabled set is a vacuous `PASS`). An enabled test-quality rubric with a valid empty typed scope also passes without a reviewer or counterfactual dispatch. Missing, prior-session, malformed, unresolved findings, or uncovered `scope-incomplete`/infrastructure faults all block. Raw outcomes and valid findings remain recorded; effective dispositions control routing. |
| `test_suite` | `.pipeline/test-suite-evidence.json` | no | A live re-inspection returning `CURRENT`. File presence alone can never satisfy this gate |
| `manual_test` | `.pipeline/manual-test-results.md` | no | The latest attempt section has no FAIL rows and is fresh. `WARN` rows record unavailable browser capability without blocking. After a recorded FAIL, HEAD must have moved before a later FAIL-free attempt is accepted |
| `prd_audit` | `.pipeline/prd-audit.md` | no | Fresh audit with exactly one graded verdict row — `PASS`, `FIXABLE`, `PLAN_GAP`, or `OVER_SCOPE` — for every acceptance criterion across the feature's stories; a `FIXABLE` row must name its owning plan task. A no-owner finding belongs in `## Findings without an owning criterion` as one unique `NC.<n>` `OVER_SCOPE` row; an `outside-visible` finding blocks until the operator decides it, and that decision binds to its evidence summary. A missing, invalid, or duplicate row blocks with a diagnostic. Verdict rows are read only from the `## Verdict Table` section when the report carries that heading, so a narrative table elsewhere (e.g. a prior-cycle history table) cannot be read as a current verdict; a report without the heading is scanned whole. An unresolvable or unreadable criterion set blocks fail-closed |
| `architecture_review_as_built` | `.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md` | no | A standalone `Verdict:` line — optionally decorated as a Markdown heading, such as `### **Verdict: APPROVED** ###` — reading `APPROVED`, `APPROVED WITH DRIFT NOTES`, or `PLAN_GAP` with `Outcome delivered: yes`. A `BLOCKED` report must carry one `## Blocking Findings` table (`Finding`, `Class`, `Governing clause`, `Summary`): a `DESIGN` finding halts for a human decision and names its governing clause; an all-`REMEDIABLE` table may take the enabled bounded remediation route. If that route cannot run or produces no usable plan, its halt names the disabled/non-daemon/planner cause and lists the findings. Malformed or exhausted reports halt needs-human. `PLAN_GAP` with `Outcome delivered: no`, missing, or unrecognized evidence also blocks |
| `rebase` | — | — | Computed from live git state, not a file |
| `finish` | `.pipeline/finish-choice` | no | A fresh final-outcome marker. Interactive intent is acquired by the foreground prompt host before publication; the coordinator writes `pr` or `keep` through `finish-record` only after the corresponding evidence is coherent. Legacy `merge-local` and `discard` markers remain readable but are never synthesized by unattended FINISH |
| `bootstrap`, `remediate`, `attribution_verify` | — | — | No completion glob. `remediate`'s output, `.pipeline/remediation.json`, is read directly by the engine to route |
| `assess` | `.docs/decisions/technical-assessment-*.md` | yes | At least one matching file |

Every predicate is fail-closed: missing, stale, malformed, or non-passing evidence leaves the gate
unsatisfied. Durable verdicts are written to `.pipeline/gates/<step>.json`.

A step the engine resolves by *skipping* never runs its predicate, but it still writes a verdict:
`{"satisfied": true, "reason": "skipped: <cause>"}`. The `skipped: ` prefix marks a gate that was
deliberately not run, so it is never mistaken for evidence that passed. This covers every skip —
tier, track, bootstrap mode, upstream skip, `disable: true`, a false `when:`, and an advisory step
auto-skipped after a failed completion check (whose reason carries the failure). See
[gates](../explanation/gates.md#what-a-gate-is).

## Starting from a step

`--from <step>` sets the loop's starting index by a linear name lookup over the resolved step
registry:

```bash
ai-conductor inline "<feature description>" --from build
```

Accepted values are the 20 sequential step names above, in underscore form, plus any custom step name
inserted through the `steps` config key. There is no dash normalization in the engine — `--from
conflict-check` is not the same string as `conflict_check`.

> **Known limitation.** `--from` is unvalidated. An unrecognized name resolves to index `-1` with no
> error and no event, and the run proceeds from that index. Check spelling and underscore form before
> relying on it. Tracked in [#1027](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1027).

## Step-to-skill mapping

Dispatch reads a single map keyed by step name. That map is the authority for what a step invokes; the
`skillName` field on the step definition is not consulted at dispatch time.

Three steps dispatch no skill at all and run entirely in the engine: `build_review`, `test_suite`,
and `attribution_verify`. Of these, `build_review` dispatches its registered rubric set (currently
only `testQuality`) and `attribution_verify` dispatches its own attribution-audit logic, both from
engine code; `test_suite` is a deterministic aggregate verifier.

Two steps dispatch the `conduct` skill with an argument rather than a skill of their own name:
`worktree` runs `/conduct worktree` and `complexity` runs `/conduct complexity`.

> **Known limitation.** Two step definitions carry a `skillName` naming a skill directory that does not
> exist: `worktree` declares `skillName: 'worktree'` and `attribution_verify` declares
> `skillName: 'attribution-verify'`. Neither `skills/worktree/` nor `skills/attribution-verify/` is on
> disk. Nothing breaks, because dispatch uses the invocation map and the model table uses its own
> skill-to-step map, but the field misleads anyone reading the step definition. The repository's
> integrity suite validates `/skill-name` references inside SKILL.md files, not `skillName` fields in
> TypeScript, so these are unguarded. Tracked in
> [#1018](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1018).
