# Settings and hooks

Every `settings.json` file the harness writes, every JSON key path it touches, and every hook it wires
into the Claude host, git, and the self-host sandbox. For operators debugging why a tool call was
blocked, and for anyone auditing what the harness installed on their machine.

Three unrelated things are called "hooks" in this repo. This page covers two of them: **host event
hooks** (`hooks/claude/*.sh` and the engine's per-worktree scripts, fired by the Claude host) and **git
hooks** (`prepare-commit-msg` / `commit-msg`, generated per worktree). The third — **config step
hooks**, `steps.<name>.hooks.before` / `.after` — is a `.ai-conductor/config.yml` key and is documented
in [configuration](configuration.md). Config step hooks are not connected to any host event.

## Settings files

Four `settings.json` files are written or merged by harness code.

| File | Owner | Written by | Tracked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | operator, machine-wide | `bin/install` (`configure_permissions`, `configure_hooks`), merged in place | n/a |
| `<project>/.claude/settings.json` | project | engine preflight `ensureClaudeSettings()`; the `bootstrap` skill | committed |
| `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json` | engine | `worktree-prepare.ts::wireSessionHookSettings()` | untracked — `.claude/` is added to the worktree's `info/exclude` |
| `<throwaway CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/settings.json` | self-build sandbox | `sandbox-build-env.ts` + `write-fence.ts::mergeFenceIntoSettings()` | ephemeral |

All four are plain Claude Code settings files. The harness writes only a subset of the schema.

### Key paths

Source-ordered by JSON path. Anything not listed here is never written by harness code.

| Key path | Value | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$schema` | `https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json` | `preflight.ts::buildSettingsJson`; `templates/claude-settings.json.template` |
| `permissions.allow[]` | array of permission strings | `bin/install::configure_permissions` (global); `preflight.ts` and the template (project); the `bootstrap` skill |
| `permissions.deny` | — | never written by any harness code path |
| `permissions.ask` | — | never written by any harness code path |
| `env` | — | never written; environment is injected at spawn time (see [environment](environment.md)) |
| `hooks.PreToolUse[]` | array of hook entries | `bin/install::configure_hooks`; `wireSessionHookSettings()`; `mergeFenceIntoSettings()`; the `bootstrap` skill |
| `hooks.PreToolUse[].matcher` | tool-name pattern, e.g. `Bash`, `Edit\|Write\|NotebookEdit`, `Task\|Agent` | same |
| `hooks.PreToolUse[].hooks[]` | array of commands for that matcher | same |
| `hooks.PreToolUse[].hooks[].type` | always `command` | same |
| `hooks.PreToolUse[].hooks[].command` | absolute path to a script | same |
| `hooks.PreToolUse[].hooks[].timeout` | seconds | `bin/install::configure_hooks`; the `bootstrap` skill |
| `hooks.PreToolUse[].hooks[].if` | `Bash(gh pr create*)` | the `bootstrap` skill only — the sole use of `if` in the harness |
| `hooks.PreToolUse[].hooks[].statusMessage` | `Running pre-PR lint gate` | the `bootstrap` skill only — the sole use of `statusMessage` |
| `hooks.PostToolUse[]` | array of hook entries | `bin/install::configure_hooks`; `wireSessionHookSettings()` |
| `hooks.PostToolUse[].matcher` | `Edit\|Write`, `Bash`, `Task\|Agent` | same |
| `hooks.PostToolUse[].hooks[].type` | always `command` | same |
| `hooks.PostToolUse[].hooks[].command` | absolute path to a script | same |
| `hooks.PostToolUse[].hooks[].timeout` | seconds | `bin/install::configure_hooks` |
| `hooks.SessionStart[].hooks[]` | one entry, no `matcher` key | `bin/install::configure_hooks` |
| `hooks.Stop[].hooks[]` | one entry, no `matcher` key | `bin/install::configure_hooks` |
| `hooks.StopFailure[].matcher` | `rate_limit` | `bin/install::configure_hooks` |
| `hooks.StopFailure[].hooks[]` | one entry | `bin/install::configure_hooks` |

`hooks.PreToolUse[].hooks[].command` is always an absolute path interpolated from the harness checkout
(`${HARNESS_DIR}/hooks/claude`) or from the worktree (`<worktree>/.pipeline/session-hooks`). Moving or
deleting either directory breaks every hook wired from it.

### Precedence

Claude Code resolves settings highest to lowest: enterprise policy, CLI args,
`.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`. Mapped onto the four
harness files:

1. `~/.claude/settings.json` — lowest precedence, but the only home of the harness's eight wired
   lifecycle hook entries. Machine-wide, additively merged, never pruned.
2. `<project>/.claude/settings.json` — committed. Permissions plus the bootstrap pre-PR lint hook.
   Created only if absent; the engine never merges it after creation.
3. `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json` — highest of the three. Engine-owned and rewritten on every
   worktree provisioning pass. Do not hand-edit it inside a build worktree.
4. Sandbox `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json` — for a self-build, layer 1 is replaced entirely by `{}`
   plus the write-fence entry. Layers 2 and 3 still apply. See [self-hosting](../guides/self-hosting.md).

**Hooks from multiple layers accumulate; they do not override.** A project running the daemon has
`docs-guard.sh` wired twice — once from `~/.claude/settings.json` (harness checkout path) and once from
`settings.local.json` (worktree `session-hooks/` path). The two script bodies are byte-identical and the
guard is idempotent, so double-firing is harmless.

### Permission sets

Three producers write a project `permissions.allow`, and they do not agree.

| Producer | Entries |
| --- | --- |
| `templates/claude-settings.json.template` | `Read(**)`, `Edit(**)`, `Write(**)` |
| `preflight.ts::buildSettingsJson` | those three, plus `Bash(git:*)`, `Bash(gh:*)`, `Bash(rtk:*)`, `Bash(npm:*)`, `Bash(npx:*)`, `Bash(node:*)`, `Bash(mkdir:*)`, `Bash(touch:*)`, `Bash(chmod:*)`, `Bash(ln:*)`, `Bash(glow:*)` |
| this repo's committed `.claude/settings.json` | the 11 `Bash(...)` allows only — no `Read`/`Edit`/`Write` |

The operator-global set `HARNESS_PERMISSIONS` in `bin/install` is 18 entries: `Read(${HARNESS_DIR}/**)`
plus 17 `Bash(...)` allows covering bundler, Rails scaffolding, `docker compose`, non-destructive git
(`init`, `add`, `commit`, `status`, `log`, `diff`, `branch`, `checkout -b`), and read-only `gh`
(`pr list`, `issue list`). `Read(${HARNESS_DIR}/**)` is absolute, so reinstalling from a different
checkout repoints it.

Destructive git operations — `push --force`, `reset --hard`, `branch -D`, `clean -f` — are deliberately
absent from every allow list, and no `permissions.deny` rules ship at all. Denial is enforced
mechanically by `hooks/claude/block-destructive-git.sh` instead.

## Wired hook events

Eight event/matcher entries are written to `~/.claude/settings.json` by `bin/install::configure_hooks`.

| Event | Matcher | Command(s) | Timeout (s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PreToolUse` | `Bash` | `block-destructive-git.sh` | 10 |
| `PreToolUse` | `Bash` | `tdd-commit-gate.sh` | 10 |
| `PreToolUse` | `Edit\|Write\|NotebookEdit` | `docs-guard.sh` | 10 |
| `PostToolUse` | `Edit\|Write` | `lint-after-edit.sh` (fires per edit; lints only at batch boundaries — see below), `spec-coverage-check.sh`, `diagram-coverage-check.sh` | 30, 10, 10 |
| `PostToolUse` | `Bash` | `post-commit-derive-feedback.sh` | 15 |
| `SessionStart` | *(no `matcher` key)* | `session-start-context.sh` | 15 |
| `Stop` | *(no `matcher` key)* | `stop-memory-reminder.sh` | 10 |
| `StopFailure` | `rate_limit` | `rate-limit-wait.sh` | 10 |

`UserPromptSubmit`, `PreCompact`, `SubagentStop`, `SessionEnd`, and `Notification` are never used.

### Engineer lifecycle evidence boundary

Engineer lifecycle events are provider-neutral engine events, not Claude hook events. The Engineer
composition root starts every registered visualizer around supported Engineer CLI commands and emits
the `engineer_*` family through `ConductorEventEmitter`. Claude host hooks may establish that a
structured tool or workflow started or failed. Codex and hosts without an equivalent hook use
`engineer run-record` for the same transitions.

The no-hook host retains the `engineerRunId` returned by `engineer worktree`, records every performed
step start and evidence-backed completion, records applicability skips, and records a failed step
plus retry before another attempt. Worktree creation and land already emit their mechanical events;
the host does not duplicate them. A rejected lifecycle command stops authoring and preserves the
worktree for recovery.

A `PostToolUse` callback cannot prove that a DECIDE step completed. Tool return proves only that the
tool invocation returned. `engineer_step_completed` accepts only an owning workflow's accepted result,
deterministic artifact validation, or land-time reconciliation. The land command validates the final
artifact set and fills any mechanically proven completion or skip events before
`engineer_land_reconciled`.

Visualizer handlers observe events and own any external projection they build. They cannot mutate the
Engineer store, reinterpret completion, or replace replay. Start, handler, and stop failures are isolated
so one visualizer cannot fail an Engineer command; durable persistence failures still fail the command.

The merge is python3-based: read, mutate in memory, `json.dump(indent=2)` plus a trailing newline. It is
idempotent and non-destructive — the merge unit is the entry, keyed on its command-string set, and an
entry is appended only if it contributes at least one new command. Operator entries are never removed.
Without `python3` on PATH the whole step is skipped with a warning.

Neither `templates/claude-settings.json.template` nor this repo's own `.claude/settings.json` contains a
`hooks` key. `~/.claude/settings.json` is the only place the `hooks/claude/*.sh` suite is registered.

## Operator hook scripts

Eleven scripts live in `hooks/claude/`. Alphabetized.

| Script | Trigger | What it does | Can block? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `block-destructive-git.sh` | `PreToolUse` / `Bash` | Strips quoted spans from the command, then pattern-matches destructive git. Emits a non-blocking NOTE on ad-hoc `git rebase`. | **Yes — exit 2** on `git push --force`/`-f`, `git reset --hard`, `git branch -D` of a not-provably-merged branch, `git clean -f`, and `git checkout -- .` / `git restore .`. `--force-with-lease` is explicitly allowed. |
| `diagram-coverage-check.sh` | `PostToolUse` / `Edit\|Write` | Warns that diagrams may be stale when a structural file is edited (Rails `app/{models,controllers,services,jobs}`, `config/routes.rb`, `db/migrate/`, compose files, `Procfile`, or `src/{models,controllers,services}`) and `.docs/architecture/` exists. | No |
| `docs-guard.sh` | `PreToolUse` / `Edit\|Write\|NotebookEdit` | Inert (exits 0 without reading stdin) unless `.pipeline/phase-active` exists. Otherwise reads a bounded payload (`timeout 3 head -c 1048576`), extracts `tool_input.file_path` or `tool_input.notebook_path` via `node -e`, normalizes a leading `$PWD/`, and default-denies `.docs/` writes unless an `allow:` prefix in the marker matches. | **Yes — exit 2** on an undeterminable target (fail-closed) and on any unallowlisted `.docs/` write. Block message names the phase and step. |
| `lint-after-edit.sh` | `PostToolUse` / `Edit\|Write` | Invoked per edit, but does **not** lint per edit. Queues the edited path under `$TMPDIR/ai-conductor-lint/<repo-hash>/` and stays silent until a batch boundary, then lints the whole queue and clears it. A boundary is `.pipeline/current-task` changing, or — outside a pipeline, where no task marker exists — `LINT_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` (default 120) elapsing since the queue opened. Dispatches by type: `.ts`/`.tsx` → ESLint (one batched invocation), `.sh` and bash-shebang files → `shellcheck --severity=error`, `.rb` → `bundle exec standardrb --no-fix`. Each is skipped silently when its tool or project context is absent. Queue state is deliberately kept out of `.pipeline/`, which is engine-owned. | No — always exits 0 |
| `post-commit-derive-feedback.sh` | `PostToolUse` / `Bash` | Despite the name, not a git post-commit hook. Invokes `conduct-ts derive-feedback --sha <sha>` for fast advisory feedback on a commit; falls back to a bash `Task:` trailer match. Never writes `task-status.json`. | No — exits 0 on every path |
| `rate-limit-wait.sh` | `StopFailure` / `rate_limit` | Reads `$CLAUDE_ERROR`, else tails `.pipeline/conduct.log`, and writes `.pipeline/rate-limit-hit` (line 1 epoch, line 2 wait seconds; default 300). | No |
| `session-start-context.sh` | `SessionStart` | Prints the whole of `HARNESS.md`, a warning if the consumer `CLAUDE.md` is missing the HARNESS.md reference, the head of `.memory/index.md`, story and plan counts, and `Pipeline: n/m steps done` from `.pipeline/conduct-state.json`. Writes `.pipeline/.memory-count-at-start`. | No |
| `spec-coverage-check.sh` | `PostToolUse` / `Edit\|Write` | Warns when a Rails `app/{models,controllers,services,jobs}` file has no counterpart under `spec/`. Skips `application_*` files. | No — warn only |
| `stop-memory-reminder.sh` | `Stop` | Compares the current `.memory/` entry count against `.pipeline/.memory-count-at-start` and reminds when work happened without a memory write. | No — no `{"decision":"block"}` output exists in any Stop hook in this repo |
| `tdd-commit-gate.sh` | `PreToolUse` / `Bash` | Reads `.pipeline/tdd-phase`. Absent ⇒ exit 0. | **Yes — exit 2** when the phase is anything other than `COMMIT` |
| `worktree-check.sh` | none | Reads `.pipeline/conduct-state.json`. Present and executable but registered in no settings block anywhere. | No |

**Exactly three of these can block a tool call with exit 2**: `block-destructive-git.sh`,
`docs-guard.sh`, and `tdd-commit-gate.sh`. Every other script is advisory and exits 0 regardless of what
it finds.

> **Known limitation.** `rate-limit-wait.sh` is registered under the event name `"StopFailure"`, which
> is not a Claude Code host event. The registration is inert: the host never fires it, so
> `.pipeline/rate-limit-hit` is never produced by the hook path and a rate-limit stop is not
> automatically waited out. Tracked in
> [#1019](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1019).

> **Known limitation.** Nothing in the engine, and no skill, writes `.pipeline/tdd-phase`. Both TDD gates
> — `hooks/claude/tdd-commit-gate.sh` and `hooks/pre-commit-tdd-gate.sh` — are therefore dormant unless
> an operator creates that file by hand. When it does exist, `tdd-commit-gate.sh` never reads stdin and
> never inspects the command, so while the phase is not `COMMIT` it blocks **every** `Bash` tool call,
> not only `git commit`. Remove `.pipeline/tdd-phase` to restore normal operation. Tracked in
> [#1009](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1009).

### Generating `docs-guard.sh`

`hooks/claude/docs-guard.sh` is a generated artifact, not hand-written. Its source is the
`DOCS_GUARD_HOOK` string constant in `src/conductor/src/engine/session-hook-assets.ts`; the checked-in
file is byte-identical to what the engine writes into each worktree.

```bash
bin/generate-docs-guard-hook           # regenerate hooks/claude/docs-guard.sh
bin/generate-docs-guard-hook --check   # compare only
```

Exit codes: `0` no drift, `1` drift (`--check`), `2` environment error. Set
`GENERATE_DOCS_GUARD_HOOK_OUT` to write elsewhere. Drift is CI-gated by
`test/test_harness_integrity.sh` — see [validation](../contributing/validation.md).

## Per-worktree engine hooks

When the engine prepares a build or spec worktree it writes two scripts into
`<worktree>/.pipeline/session-hooks/` (mode 0755) and wires two entries into
`<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json` with absolute paths baked in.

| Script | Event / matcher | What it does | Can block? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pre-dispatch.sh` | `PreToolUse` / `Task\|Agent` | When line 1 matches `^Task: ([A-Za-z0-9._-]+\|none)$`, appends advisory dispatch telemetry and flips that known task row to `in_progress`. Any missing, malformed, unknown, locked, or unwritable telemetry abstains. | No — attribution is telemetry only. |
| `docs-guard.sh` | `PreToolUse` / `Edit\|Write\|NotebookEdit` | Byte-identical to `hooks/claude/docs-guard.sh`. | **Yes — exit 2** |

Re-provisioning is idempotent: `replaceSessionHookEntry` removes only entries with the same matcher
*and* a command containing the `session-hooks/` marker, then appends. Operator-authored entries survive.
The whole wiring path is fail-open — any error logs `session hook settings: skipped` and the worktree is
used anyway.

Provisioning removes the retired `post-dispatch.sh` and `mutation-gate.sh` scripts and settings entries
from previously prepared worktrees.

## Git hooks

The engine generates three git hooks per worktree, into `<worktree>/.pipeline/git-hooks/` (mode 0755), and
points the worktree at them:

```bash
git -C <worktree> config extensions.worktreeConfig true
git -C <worktree> config --worktree extensions.worktreeConfig true
git -C <worktree> config --worktree core.hooksPath <worktree>/.pipeline/git-hooks
```

| Hook | Trigger | What it does | Can block? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pre-commit` | every commit in the worktree | While `.pipeline/phase-active` exists and its phase is `BUILD` or `SHIP`, rejects any staged path under a protected artifact directory (`PROTECTED_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORIES` in `protected-artifact-seal.ts` — `.docs/architecture`, `.docs/decisions`, `.docs/plans`, `.docs/specs`, `.docs/stories`) unless an `allow:` prefix in the marker matches it or its stem names the worktree's own feature (from `.pipeline/task-status.json`'s `plan_ref`, date prefix ignored). A malformed or escaping staged path (empty, absolute, or containing `..`/`.`) is always rejected. Provider-agnostic — it fires for any commit in the worktree, regardless of which host or CLI created it, unlike the Claude-only `docs-guard.sh` PreToolUse hook. | **Yes — exit 1** naming every offender and directing the amendment to DECIDE. |
| `prepare-commit-msg` | every commit in the worktree | Stamps `Task: <id>` from `<worktree>/.pipeline/current-task` using `git interpret-trailers --if-exists replace`. Fires only when no explicit trailer is already present. Abstains on amend, on rebase replay, and on an empty staged diff. | No |
| `commit-msg` | every commit in the worktree | Validates a supplied `Task:` trailer, checks its staged paths against the active task's declared files, then emits non-blocking warnings for bundling and subject mismatch. An out-of-scope path is reported with a copy-pasteable `Scope: <path> — <rationale>` widening. Containment defaults to report-only; set `build_review.scopeContainmentEnforced: true` to refuse verified violations. | **Yes — exit 1** (git-hook convention) when a supplied trailer uses the `task-N` form or names an id absent from `.pipeline/task-status.json`, or when enforced scope-check returns exit `2`. |

All three hooks chain to `$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/hooks/<name>` when one exists and is
executable. `pre-commit` and `prepare-commit-msg` are pure bash plus `git` and POSIX tools (`pre-commit`
also uses `sed`; `prepare-commit-msg` uses `node -e`). `commit-msg` additionally invokes the installed
`conduct-ts scope-check <commit-message>` command; none of the three hooks references `dist/`.

`pre-commit` and `commit-msg` both exit 0 immediately for any commit made with `CONDUCT_ENGINE_COMMIT=1`
— the environment the engine sets for its own bookkeeping commits (rebase mechanics, quarantine, shipped
records, spec landing). `commit-msg` additionally exits 0 for merge commits (`MERGE_HEAD` present),
`--amend`, and rebase replay.

The scope checker has three outcomes. Exit `0` means the commit is allowed: it covers both in-scope commits
and an out-of-scope commit reported under the report-only default. Exit `2` is a positive refusal reserved
for a future enforcement flip, which `commit-msg` converts to Git's blocking exit `1`. Any other exit is an
abstention — for example, missing or malformed task state — and `commit-msg` logs that it allowed the commit.
Only a task-attributed commit with a usable in-progress task row is checked. Add one `Scope:` trailer per
out-of-scope staged path when the widening is intentional; the engine records accepted widenings for
`build_review`, which remains the semantic scope authority.

`hooks/pre-commit-tdd-gate.sh` ships in the tree but is copy-it-yourself only; nothing installs it, and
it is subject to the dormant-`tdd-phase` limitation above. It is unrelated to the engine-installed
`pre-commit` hook above, which is generated fresh per worktree from `PRE_COMMIT_HOOK` in
`git-hook-assets.ts` rather than copied from that file.

Hook installation itself is fail-closed for `pre-commit`/`prepare-commit-msg`/`commit-msg`: a worktree
with a `.git` present but not writable, or any other failure while writing or wiring the three scripts,
raises rather than silently continuing, so a worktree can never enter BUILD/SHIP without the preventive
gate installed. A worktree with no `.git` at all (a plain temporary directory, as some unit-level setup
tests use) has no commit surface to protect and is skipped as a no-op, not an error. This is a change
from the historical behavior, where every git-hook failure was swallowed and logged.

Trailer semantics — which trailers are gates and which are telemetry — are documented in
[artifacts](artifacts.md).

## Self-host sandbox write-fence

For a harness self-build the engine generates a fifth hook that is not a file in `hooks/`.
`generateFenceScript(worktreeRoot, harnessRoot)` bakes both absolute roots into a standalone bash script
written to the throwaway `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and `mergeFenceIntoSettings()` appends it under
`hooks.PreToolUse`:

```json
{
  "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash",
  "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "<sandbox>/write-fence.sh" }]
}
```

| Situation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Target under the worktree root | Allow (exit 0) |
| Target under the harness root but outside the worktree | **Block (exit 2)** |
| Read-only Bash (`grep`, `cat`, `diff`, …) | Allow (exit 0) |
| Unrelated path (other repos, OS temp) | Allow (exit 0) |
| Target could not be determined | **Block (exit 2)** |
| Malformed or empty payload | Allow (exit 0) |

The fence takes no environment variables — only the two baked-in roots. See
[self-hosting](../guides/self-hosting.md) for when it is provisioned.

### What the fence does NOT block

The fence has no rule for `git push`, `gh`, or any network operation, and the `claude` provider is
dispatched with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, no OS sandbox, and full environment inheritance.
(`codex` is the sandboxed provider: unattended runs pass `sandbox_mode="workspace-write"`.)

Because a claude self-build dispatch therefore cannot be fenced away from pushing or from `gh`, the
engine refutes any dispatch output that says otherwise. `environment-claim-audit.ts` runs inside the
self-host candidate-safety wrapper: when a line carries an environmental cause, a blocking assertion,
**and** a named remote operation the generated fence provably cannot deny, the attempt is failed and
the disproof becomes its retry reason, prefixed `ENVIRONMENT_CLAIM_REFUTED`. The deniable-operation
set is derived from `generateFenceScript` itself, so teaching the fence a real `git push` rule
retires the refutation automatically. Claims on a sandboxed or unrecognized provider are never
refuted — the audit only rejects what the engine can positively disprove. See
[stalled or stuck feature](../runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md) for triage.

## Malformed settings.json

Six writers touch a settings file, and each handles unparseable JSON differently.

| Writer | Behavior on malformed JSON |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/install::configure_permissions` | `json.load` raises, nothing is written, the file is left intact — but the installer still reports success (see the callout below) |
| `bin/install::configure_hooks` | Prints `⚠ Could not configure hooks automatically`; the file is left intact. Invoked as `… \|\| warn`, so `set -e` never aborts the install |
| `worktree-prepare.ts::wireSessionHookSettings` | Renames the file to `<path>.bak-<epoch>`, logs the reason, and rebuilds from `{}`. Never discards content |
| `write-fence.ts::mergeFenceIntoSettings` | Silently discards and restarts from `{"hooks":{"PreToolUse":[]}}` |
| `preflight.ts::ensureClaudeSettings` | Never parses. A malformed project `settings.json` is left untouched forever, and the preflight reports nothing |
| `sandbox-build-env.ts::provisionTrustState` | Malformed operator `~/.claude.json` propagates no workspace trust — the sandbox never guesses trust |

> **Known limitation.** `bin/install::configure_permissions` reports success on a malformed
> `settings.json`. `rm -f "$perms_file"` runs between the python3 heredoc and the `if [ $? -eq 0 ]`
> check, so `$?` holds `rm`'s exit code, not python's. The installer prints `✓ Permissions:` with an
> empty count and no permissions are actually added. If your allow list looks unchanged after
> `bin/install`, validate the file with `python3 -m json.tool ~/.claude/settings.json` and fix the JSON
