# Shipped record reconciliation

Land the missing `.docs/shipped/<slug>.md` for work that already shipped, so the daemon stops
re-dispatching it. For operators who finished a feature by hand.

> **Not sure this is the right runbook?** Run `/daemon-triage` — it gathers the evidence
> read-only, classifies the failure, and routes to the one runbook that owns it.

**A manual PR is not a harness finish.** Opening and merging a PR yourself tells the daemon
nothing. The only thing that records a ship is a committed shipped record on the base branch.

## Symptom

- The daemon keeps dispatching a feature whose implementation is already merged.
- `ai-conductor daemon park <slug>` is the only thing holding it back — and you have to keep it
  parked forever.
- The startup dashboard lists the slug under ELIGIBLE even though its PR shows as merged.
- `ai-conductor shipment-evidence --pr <url>` exits 1 with a `shipped-record-*` code.

Parking is a stopgap, not a finish. A parked feature is one you can never unpark, and its park
marker is indistinguishable from a deliberate operational hold.

## Diagnosis

### 1. Is the record on the base branch?

The dedup check reads shipped records **only** from the base-branch tree — via
`git ls-tree <base-branch>:.docs/shipped` and `git show <base-branch>:<path>`. A record that
exists in your working tree, or on an unmerged branch, is invisible by construction.

```bash
git ls-tree --name-only <base-branch>:.docs/shipped | grep "<slug>"
git show <base-branch>:.docs/shipped/<slug>.md
```

`<slug>` is the plan file stem: `.docs/plans/<slug>.md` → `<slug>`.

### 2. Is the record well-formed?

A valid record starts with a frontmatter block, exactly:

```yaml
---
slug: <slug>
spec_hash: <sha256-hex>
pr: <pr url | local>
shipped: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---
```

The parser requires line 0 to be exactly `---`, a closing `---`, and non-empty `slug` and
`spec_hash`. Anything else parses as malformed. A malformed record still dedups **by stem** — it
just cannot dedup a renamed spec by content hash.

### 3. Ask the verifier

```bash
ai-conductor shipment-evidence --pr <implementation-pr-url>
```

| Output | Meaning | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shipped-record: valid <path>` | Record present and bound to this PR. | 0 |
| `shipped-record: not applicable (<class>)` | This PR is not an implementation PR for a plan. | 0 |
| `shipped-record: <refusal-code>` | Named defect — e.g. `shipped-record-missing`, `shipped-record-not-in-candidate`, `shipped-record-incomplete`, `shipped-record-hash-mismatch`. | 1 |

The evaluator deliberately refuses to infer a successful ship from merge state alone. A merged PR
with no record is a defect, not a ship.

### 4. Check the daemon's local ledger

```bash
cat .daemon/processed/<slug>
```

`{"status":"shipped","prUrl":"…"}` means the daemon has already recorded the ship locally. This
cache is a fast path, not the authority — the base-branch record is. A missing cache entry
alongside a present base-branch record is harmless; the daemon repairs the cache the first time
the dedup fires.

## Recovery

Pick the branch that matches where the implementation is. Every one of them ends in
`ai-conductor shipped-record`, so read this first — it applies to all of them.

> **Known limitation — do not trust the exit code.** `ai-conductor shipped-record` is
> degrade-never-block by contract: *any* failure (unreadable plan, ambiguous candidates,
> filesystem error, git error) prints one warning — `shipped-record write failed — dedup degraded
> to local cache for <slug>: <reason>` — and **exits 0**. A clean exit does not mean a record was
> written, and dedup silently falls back to the local `.daemon/processed/` cache, which a later
> daemon on another checkout does not see. Always verify with `git cat-file -e` (see
> [Verification](#verification)). Tracked in [#1023](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1023).

### The implementation branch has not merged yet

This is the normal path and the cheapest one. Run the command **in the implementation worktree,
on the implementation branch**, before the final push:

```bash
cd .worktrees/<slug>
ai-conductor shipped-record --slug <slug> --pr <implementation-pr-url>
```

**What it changes:**

1. Resolves the plan identity — `.docs/plans/<slug>.md` exactly, else exactly one
   `.docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` candidate. Two candidates is `ambiguous`; zero is
   `missing`. It never guesses.
2. Hashes the plan bytes plus its stories file (the plan's `**Stories:**` reference first, else
   `.docs/stories/<slug>.md`) into `spec_hash`.
3. Renders the record, appending a Cost block when a cost rollup is available: `input`,
   `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_creation`, `cost_usd`, `dispatches`, `retries`, `halts`,
   `unmetered`, and a per-provider breakdown; then appends a `## Time` block computed
   independently from `.pipeline/events.jsonl`. Its field contract and compatibility behavior are
   in the [shipped-record reference](../reference/artifacts.md#shipped-records). A missing or corrupt
   event ledger never blocks the Cost block or the commit.
4. Writes `.docs/shipped/<slug>.md`, `git add`s it, and commits `shipped record: <slug>` with
   `--no-verify` — but **only if the staged diff is non-empty**. Re-running with identical
   content prints `✓ shipped record already committed: <path>` and creates no duplicate commit.

Use `--pr local` instead of a URL for a merge-local finish. Never run it for a `keep` or
`discard` finish — those did not ship.

> **Known limitation.** The Cost block's `halts:` field counts persisted `loop_halt` events from
> `.pipeline/events.jsonl`; it is written into every committed shipped record and re-read by
> `ai-conductor kpi`. Use it as the ledger-derived count of recorded halt occurrences. `.pipeline/HALT`
> remains the durable current park signal, and the daemon log provides immediate diagnostic detail.
> The per-provider breakdown is written but never surfaced: `ai-conductor kpi` has no parser for the
> `providers:` lines.

Then push, and merge the PR. The record rides in with the code, so the merge lands the
implementation and the shipped fact atomically:

```bash
git push
```

### The implementation PR is already merged

Do not commit a record onto the base branch by hand. Use the reconciler, which branches off
`main`, writes only the record, and never mutates main:

```bash
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=<owner>/<repo>
ai-conductor shipment-evidence reconcile --pr <implementation-pr-url> --shipped <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

**What it changes:** creates `shipment-repair/<pr-number>/<slug>` off `main`, commits exactly one
file (the write is asserted to be a `.docs/shipped/*.md` path — anything else throws), opens or
finds the matching repair PR, re-verifies the evidence at the immutable repair head, and posts a
`shipped-record` commit status carrying the verdict. The injected publisher surface offers no
merge, approve, or auto-merge operation — a human merges the repair PR.

`--shipped` must match `YYYY-MM-DD`. `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is required; without it the run throws
`GITHUB_REPOSITORY is required for repair publication`.

| Output | Meaning | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shipped-record: aligned` | Nothing to repair. | 0 |
| `shipped-record: repair-published` | Repair branch and PR exist; merge it. | 0 |
| `shipped-record: unresolved` | The defect is not one of the repairable record codes. | **1** |

**Blast radius:** none on `main` — the repair only ever exists on its own branch until you merge
it. **Confirm:** the repair PR exists and its head carries a `shipped-record` commit status of
`success`.

### Hold the line while you fix it

Park the slug so the daemon stops burning dispatches during the repair, and unpark once the
record is merged:

```bash
ai-conductor daemon park <slug>
# …land the record…
ai-conductor daemon unpark <slug>
```

Ordering rules are in
[emergency stop a running feature](emergency-stop-a-running-feature.md).

If the implementation PR is already merged (the case this section is under), landing the record
is usually enough on its own: the daemon's [parked-feature reconciliation
sweep](../guides/running-the-daemon.md#parked-feature-reconciliation) detects the newly-committed
record on `origin/main` on its next idle tick and removes the worktree, deletes the branch, and
unparks the slug automatically — `daemon unpark` is then unnecessary. The record alone is enough;
the sweep no longer needs the branch to still exist. If the branch does still exist and carries
commits that cleanup cannot prove safe to delete, the sweep refuses it with a specific reason; an
`unmerged-commits` refusal lists the commits that would be dropped. Merge or otherwise resolve the
listed work, and the next tick reconciles the slug. Run
`ai-conductor daemon reconcile-parked <slug>` to do the same thing immediately instead of waiting
for the next tick, or if `reconcile_parked_auto_cleanup` is set to `false`.

### The spec was renamed after it shipped

You do not need a second record. The daemon runs two dedup passes: a stem match, then a
content-hash match that compares the candidate's freshly computed `spec_hash` against every
committed record's. A renamed spec whose plan and stories bytes are unchanged still dedups, and
the local cache is repaired under the **new** slug.

If the plan or stories content changed, the hash no longer matches and the candidate is a
genuinely different spec — it will be dispatched, correctly.

## Verification

Verify the record, then verify that the dedup actually took. The first without the second is the
mistake this runbook exists to prevent.

### The record is committed

```bash
git cat-file -e "HEAD:.docs/shipped/<slug>.md" && echo "record committed"
```

This is the check the `finish` flow itself trusts, precisely because the command's exit code is
not trustworthy. Run it in the worktree whose branch you committed on.

### The record is on the base branch

```bash
git show <base-branch>:.docs/shipped/<slug>.md
```

Until the PR merges, this fails — and until it succeeds, the daemon cannot see the record at all.

### The record parses and binds to the PR

```bash
ai-conductor shipment-evidence --pr <implementation-pr-url>
```

Expect `shipped-record: valid <path>` and exit 0.

### The dedup actually fired

Two independent signals, both on the next daemon poll after the merge:

1. The daemon log carries the skip line:
   ```bash
   ai-conductor daemon logs --lines 200 | grep "shipped dedup"
   ```
   Expect `skip <slug>: shipped dedup — implementation already merged (base-branch shipped
   record found); not re-dispatching.` — or, for a renamed spec, `skip <slug>: shipped dedup —
   shipped under '<stem>', candidate '<slug>' matches by content (spec_hash); not
   re-dispatching.`

   This message is logged **once** and suppressed thereafter by a `.daemon/warned/<slug>`
   marker. Its absence from a later log is not evidence of failure — use signal 2.

2. The local processed cache was repaired:
   ```bash
   cat .daemon/processed/<slug>
   ```
   Expect `{"status":"shipped","prUrl":"<url>"}`. The daemon writes this when the base-branch
   dedup fires, so its presence proves the dedup ran.

### The slug leaves the eligible set

```bash
ai-conductor daemon logs --lines 60
```

In the startup dashboard the slug must appear under PROCESSED — not ELIGIBLE, and not PARKED.
If it is still PARKED, you have not unparked it, and the park is masking whether the dedup works.
Unpark and re-check.

Verify the shipped record's `halts:` count against the persisted `loop_halt` occurrences in that
feature's `.pipeline/events.jsonl`. A count of `0` means no `loop_halt` occurrence was recorded;
use `.pipeline/HALT` and the daemon log for the current park state and diagnostic detail.
