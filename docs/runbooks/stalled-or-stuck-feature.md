# Stalled or stuck feature

Diagnose and clear a feature that is dispatched but not progressing: no-task-progress stalls,
provider-preparation exhaustion, build-progress ceilings, rate-limit waits, auth parks, and
kickback loops. For operators reading `.pipeline/` state and the daemon log.

> **Not sure this is the right runbook?** Run `/daemon-triage` — it gathers the evidence
> read-only, classifies the failure, and routes to the one runbook that owns it.

## Symptom

Any of these:

- The daemon log shows `▶ start <slug>` and then nothing for a long time.
- `■ done <slug>: halted` or `■ done <slug>: error` appears and the slug stops being dispatched.
- The startup dashboard lists the slug under HALTED instead of IN-PROGRESS or ELIGIBLE.
- The dashboard lists a reason and `remedy:` line for a PARKED, HALTED, or retained slug.
- The same build step retries repeatedly with the same reason.
- A feature is marked complete but the PR never appeared.

## Diagnosis

All per-feature evidence lives in the feature's own worktree: `.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/`.
All daemon-level evidence lives at the main repo root: `.daemon/`.

### Blocked merged spec

**Symptom:** A merged plan never dispatches, and `ai-conductor daemon status` lists it in `BLOCKED`
with a reason and remedy. This is a discovery refusal, not a feature HALT: no feature worktree or
`.pipeline/HALT` exists yet. The startup dashboard does not render this state
([#1332](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1332)); use `daemon status`.

**Diagnosis:** Read the `BLOCKED` line. Common reasons are `unresolvable-stories-ref`,
`stories-missing`, `stories-not-approved`, `adr-not-approved`, `no-dependency-tree`, and
`missing-coherence`. `adr-not-approved` means the default branch's `.docs/decisions/` corpus
contains an ADR whose first declared status is not `APPROVED` or `SUPERSEDED` (or that declares no
status); it blocks every merged spec, not just the one it names. The
snapshot is `.daemon/blocked.json`; a missing or malformed snapshot means only that no completed
discovery pass is available, not that the spec is clear.

**Recovery:** Apply the line's remedy on the repository's default branch. Do not repair only a
feature branch or a local working tree: discovery reads the committed default-branch tree. After an
upgrade that adds this visibility, the first discovery pass may dispatch a previously invisible,
otherwise-buildable merged spec when the repository has no processed marker for it. That is expected;
review the plan before starting the daemon if those older specs are not ready to build.

**Verification:** Run `ai-conductor daemon status` after the next pass. A repaired spec disappears
from `BLOCKED` and is eligible for dispatch; a remaining entry includes its current remedy.

### First, read the committed halt record

For an operator-actionable halt, read `.docs/halted/<slug>.md` from the feature branch before
consulting worktree-local state. The committed record survives a recreated worktree and can be
read from any clone that has the feature branch:

```bash
git show <feature-branch>:.docs/halted/<slug>.md
```

It gives the halt class, step, phase, branch, HEAD SHA, timestamp, and complete HALT body. A
`Status: resolved` record preserves those original details and also records how and when it was
cleared. `mechanical` halts deliberately create no record, so begin with the live marker when this
file is absent for that class.

The push is best-effort. If the daemon reports `halt_record_push_failed`, the record was still
committed locally on the daemon host but may not be visible from the remote branch. Read it from
that feature worktree instead:

```bash
git -C .worktrees/<slug> show HEAD:.docs/halted/<slug>.md
```

Repair the push failure separately; do not treat a missing remote copy as a missing halt record.

### 1. Read the halt marker

```bash
head -1 .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT
cat .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT.class
```

`.pipeline/HALT` is the durable park state for that feature: the daemon never advances, opens a PR,
or merges past it. The first non-empty line of the body is the reason the dashboard surfaces. Read
it by name during recovery; persisted halt events in `.pipeline/events.jsonl` supplement this marker
and do not replace it.

`.pipeline/HALT.class` classifies it. Every HALT the daemon writes now carries one — the daemon
stamps any HALT still missing a class at startup as `legacy`, once per feature, so the sidecar is
never absent for long. Content the reader doesn't recognize still reads as `unclassified`.

| Class | Meaning | Cleared by the re-kick sweep? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `needs-human` | Only an operator can resolve it. A detail naming a remediation-planner mismatch is a plan gap wearing this class; see [the remediation planner disagreed with the parsed findings](#the-remediation-planner-disagreed-with-the-parsed-findings). | No — except a matching, one-use `kickback-budget` authorization for a budget-cap halt. |
| `kickback-cap` | A bounded `prd_audit` or as-built-review remediation allowance is exhausted. | No — except a matching, one-use `kickback-budget` authorization. |
| `plan-gap` | `prd_audit` or the as-built review found an outcome no active plan task owns; see [the plan-gap recovery](#the-halt-is-a-plan-gap). | No — skipped on every sweep. |
| `mechanical` | The daemon may safely retry it. | Yes, on a base-branch advance. |
| `protected-artifact` | BUILD or SHIP found a genuine protected DECIDE-artifact violation. | No — skipped on every sweep until an operator resolves it. |
| `legacy` | Predates total classification; stamped by the daemon's startup migration. | Yes, on a base-branch advance, same as `mechanical`. |
| *(absent / unrecognized)* | Treated as `unclassified`. | No — skipped on every sweep, same as `needs-human`. |

A feature that errors gets a diagnostic HALT written at the deterministic
`.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT` path even when worktree creation itself fails. Read and clear
that marker after fixing the cause. If the daemon log reports `unrecoverable-state`, it could not
write that marker; repair the target directory or permissions first, then re-run the dispatch.

`NEVER-STARTED` is not a halt: the dashboard found no readable `conduct-state.json`, and the feature
remains dispatchable. Do not reclaim or unpark it merely to make it run. For a retained row, follow
its `remedy:` line: an open PR needs no action until it lands; a closed, unknown, or legacy PR state
can be handled with `ai-conductor daemon reclaim-worktree <slug>` when reclaim is appropriate.

### 2. Classify the stall

```bash
grep -E 'build_stall|build_no_progress|zero_work_product|rate_limit|credentials_park' \
  .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/events.jsonl | tail -20
```

### A later step is blocked by an unsatisfied prerequisite

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` says `Step '<step>' is blocked by unsatisfied prerequisite` and
lists one or more prerequisite names with their recorded statuses. The HALT class is
`needs-human`.

**Diagnosis:** The listed prerequisite cannot run again automatically: it is no longer `pending`.
Read that prerequisite's halt record or its earlier events before changing anything. A `refused`
status means the prerequisite's own work was not judged failed; its original HALT explains the
operator action required.

**Recovery:** Resolve the prerequisite's stated cause, then clear `HALT` and `HALT.class` using
[the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume). Do not hand-edit
`conduct-state.json` to mark the prerequisite done or failed. The resumed conductor admits the
unsatisfied prerequisite again and preserves already completed steps.

**Verification:** Run `ai-conductor daemon status` after the next dispatch. The prerequisite runs
again; the blocked later step does not remain the terminal step unless the underlying condition is
still unresolved.

#### `no_task_progress`

The build step's circuit breaker. From attempt 2 onward, the step is declared stalled only when
**both** signals stay pinned across the attempt: the count of resolved plan tasks did not
increase, **and** HEAD did not move. The resolved count is the **union** of two sources:

- rows in `.pipeline/task-status.json` whose `status` is `completed` or `skipped`, and
- plan task ids carried by `Task: <id>` trailers on commits in
  `merge-base(origin/<default-branch>, HEAD)..HEAD`.

So a task committed with a valid `Task:` trailer counts as resolved even if its row was never
flipped. Work committed with **no** `Task:` trailer and no row update is invisible to the
*count* — but not to the breaker, because it still moves HEAD.

**Commit movement is the liveness authority
(adr-2026-07-23-commit-movement-liveness-floor).** The attributed-task count is advisory
routing and telemetry; it never independently proves a build is stuck. An attempt that lands
real, committed-but-un-trailered work moves HEAD while the count stays pinned, and is
classified `unattributed_progress` — telemetry, not a stall — instead of `no_task_progress`.
A SHA read that fails on either side of the attempt is treated fail-closed, degrading to the
old count-only behavior. A genuine wedge (zero commits, count pinned) still stalls and halts
exactly as before: count alone can never kill a build.

If the build step's retry budget then exhausts with at least one HEAD-moving attempt, the run
does **not** take the generic "retries exhausted" HALT. It routes into `build_review` — the
sole completion authority — through the same seam a normally-completed build uses, recording
the unresolved plan task ids in `conduct-state.json` (`build_routed_reason`). This route requires
a clean worktree. That is not an always-pass: `build_review` re-grades the diff independently and
can still FAIL the routed build, kicking it back to `build` under the same
`MAX_KICKBACKS_PER_GATE` bound as any other `build_review` kickback. A build with zero commit
movement across every attempt never routes.

#### Build halted with uncommitted paths

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` names one or more uncommitted paths, for example
`2 uncommitted paths: src/a.ts, test/a.test.ts`. The build cannot complete or use the exhausted-
but-working route while those paths remain dirty.

**Recovery:** inspect the named paths, then either commit the intended work or discard only the
named paths when it is not intended. Do not clear the halt first or re-dispatch around the dirty
tree. Once the worktree is clean, use [the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume).

**Verification:** `git status --porcelain` in the feature worktree prints no output before the
resumed build advances.

In daemon mode the engine synthesizes a remediation prompt into
`.pipeline/build-stall-question.md` and dispatches `/remediate`, bounded to 2 remediation
rounds per gate. A zero-work stall never terminal-HALTs from that path; it falls through to the
ordinary retry and park route.

#### Unresolved step command

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` reads `Cannot dispatch '<step>': /<command> is not available in
the provider skill catalog.` and its class is `mechanical`.

**Diagnosis:** the provider ran but reported the exact dispatched slash command as unknown —
the run's home is missing the skill that step renders to. This is a deterministic environment
failure: retrying, escalating model or effort, or walking providers cannot make a command
appear in a catalog that does not have it, so the conductor halts immediately instead of
spending further attempts.

**Recovery:** re-provision the provider home (or self-host sandbox) with the missing skill, then
clear the HALT using [the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume). Because
this is a `mechanical`-class HALT, the daemon's ordinary re-kick sweep also clears it on a
base-branch advance — but re-kicking without fixing the catalog just reproduces the halt on
the next dispatch.

**Verification:** after the next dispatch, the daemon log shows the step's command resolving
and the run advancing past it; it must not return to the same `commandUnresolved` HALT.

#### Unresolved build-review rubric skill

**Symptom:** the event log contains `build_review_rubric_infrastructure_failure` with reason
`invalid-provider-result`. Its `excerpt` says that a build-review rubric skill could not be
dispatched and names the unresolved command when the provider supplied it.

**Diagnosis:** the rubric produced no judgement. The provider reported that its dispatched skill
command is unavailable, so the conductor stops that auxiliary member immediately instead of
retrying it, requesting a judged-result repair, or trying another configured provider.

**Recovery:** relink or re-provision the provider skill catalog. If the feature branch predates
the rubric skill, rebase it onto a base that contains the skill. Then use [the resume
procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume) when the feature has a HALT; otherwise rerun
the blocked build-review gate.

**Verification:** the next build-review event is a rubric result or another actionable
infrastructure failure, not the same unresolved-command excerpt.

#### Provider preparation exhausted

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` begins `Provider preparation exhausted.` and its class is
`needs-human`. The daemon log or dashboard may also show the provider lifecycle as `recovering`
followed by `halted` with `preparation-timeout-exhausted` and recovery `1`.

**Diagnosis:** read the marker body:

```bash
cat .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT
cat .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT.class
```

It names the logical `step`, `phase: preparing`, attempt id, elapsed milliseconds, and recovery
count. The timeout applies only before a provider process starts: candidate resolution, session
setup, or self-host preparation did not complete within
`provider_preparation_timeout_minutes`. The first expiration already used the one automatic
replacement; because this is a `needs-human` HALT, the re-kick sweep will not clear it.

Do not diagnose this from `.pipeline/step-heartbeat`. Heartbeats are activity telemetry only, and a
quiet running provider is not automatically killed, retried, or replaced.

**Recovery:** repair the preparation failure. If preparation is expected to take longer, increase
`provider_preparation_timeout_minutes` in the active configuration; `0` or a negative value
disables that pre-spawn deadline. Do not use `step_heartbeat_stall_minutes`: it is a deprecated
compatibility no-op and cannot change provider lifecycle behavior. Then clear the HALT using
[the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume).

**Verification:** after the next dispatch, the dashboard/log shows a new `preparing` attempt and,
once spawned, `running`; it must not return to `halted` with
`preparation-timeout-exhausted`. Confirm the resumed feature with the general
[verification steps](#verification).

#### Live-boundary violation (self-host only)

If `.pipeline/HALT` reads `<live checkout|provider state> changed during self-host execution — N
added, N removed, N changed: …`, the self-host live boundary detected a change to the harness
checkout or to the operator's real `~/.claude`/`~/.codex` while a step was in flight. **The reason
names the paths** — each tagged `added`, `removed`, or `changed`, capped at eight entries followed by
`and N more`, with exact counts. Read them before investigating anything else.

First determine whether the completed dispatch was proven contained. A contained dispatch records
`self_host_containment_verdict` and, when the live checkout changed, a
`contained_live_checkout_drift` event in `.pipeline/events.jsonl`. That event names the containment
evidence, labels the drift `concurrent-operator`, and does not write a HALT: the dispatch could not
have made the live checkout writable. A clean contained dispatch still records its containment
verdict. If the verdict says containment was unavailable, disabled, or its probe failed, the
ordinary fail-closed behavior below applies.

- A path under the live checkout is usually an untracked file an operator session wrote — a
  permission or approval grant (Claude Code's `.claude/settings.local.json` is untracked and
  fingerprinted), a scratch or generated artifact, or a new file staged with `git add`. Git can
  say a path is tracked but not who wrote it, so the guard fails closed on everything it cannot
  attribute. An edit or deletion of an **already-tracked** file reports `M`/`D` and does not halt;
  a git operation that rewrites tracked content without leaving it modified (`git pull`,
  `git checkout`, `git stash`) does halt, because `git status` then comes back clean. Batch
  root-checkout work between dispatches, or do it inside a worktree — see the live-checkout rule
  in `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`'s **Daemon Operations Safety** section. Issue #1301 tracks the
  attribution machinery that will remove this false-halt class.
- A provider-state path that is config-like (`settings.json`, `config.toml`, `hooks.json`) means an
  unrelated interactive session changed operator config mid-build. That trip is deliberate and
  fail-closed — those files stay fingerprinted precisely because a real leak would look identical.
- A provider-state path that is pure telemetry or cache means the exclusion list needs a new entry;
  see [self-hosting: provider-state
  exclusions](../guides/self-hosting.md#provider-state-exclusions).

**`EROFS` during a contained dispatch:** a `Read-only file system` failure usually means the
dispatch attempted a legitimate live-checkout write that is absent from the shared
`LIVE_CHECKOUT_VOLATILE` policy. Confirm the attempted path from the provider output and verify it
is an intended, safe volatile surface. As a short-lived recovery, set
`harness_self_host.live_containment: false` for the affected run; this restores the fail-closed
boundary guard, so avoid concurrent root-checkout changes. Then correct the shared
`LIVE_CHECKOUT_VOLATILE` policy and its containment bind set with focused tests; do not add an
ad-hoc local carve-out. Resume the feature using [the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume).

**Verification:** after resume, inspect `.pipeline/events.jsonl`. A repaired contained dispatch has
one `self_host_containment_verdict` with `contained: true`; concurrent live-checkout drift, if any,
has one `contained_live_checkout_drift` record with `attribution: "concurrent-operator"` and its
changed-path summary. A temporary opt-out instead must either remain clean or halt with the
uncontained reason, never silently ignore drift.

This is a `mechanical`-class HALT, so the daemon's ordinary re-kick sweep clears it on the next
base-branch advance. The step that was running keeps its own real verdict, so the re-kick resumes
after it rather than repeating it.

#### Retained draft PR identity is unavailable (self-host only)

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` begins `Self-host release gate HALT: retained draft PR identity is
unavailable — no OPEN pull request exists for <branch> into <base>.`

**Diagnosis:** the release gate reads its release metadata from the draft PR opened at SHIP-phase
entry. When the in-memory URL is absent — the ship-start `git push` failed, for instance — the engine
looks the PR up by branch instead, and only an **OPEN** PR whose head is that branch and whose base is
the build's base branch satisfies it. Reproduce the same lookup:

```bash
gh pr list --head <branch> --base <base> --state open --json url,state
```

- **Rows come back.** The gate should have resolved it; capture the daemon log line
  `[ship-draft-pr] branch lookup for <branch> …` and treat it as a bug.
- **Empty, but a PR exists in `--state all`.** It is closed or merged. That is not a draft the finish
  step may flip or rewrite — open a fresh PR for the branch, or land the work as already-shipped via
  `ai-conductor shipped-record`.
- **Empty entirely.** No PR was ever opened; check whether the branch reached origin (`git push`
  failures are logged as `[ship-draft-pr] push of <branch> failed`) and push it.

**Recovery:** ensure an OPEN PR exists for the branch into the base with valid release metadata in its
body, then clear the HALT using [the resume
procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume).

#### FINISH publication halts

A FINISH publication failure or non-converging progress halts one of four ways, and the marker says which:

- `FINISH publication retry exhausted: <reason>` — the reason was transient (transport, GitHub,
  filesystem, provider judgment, or a re-observation), so every attempt in the budget was spent
  before giving up.
- `FINISH publication cannot proceed: <reason> is not retryable — …` — the reason can never be
  satisfied by re-running the identical transition, so the run halted on the **first** observation
  and the retry budget was deliberately left unspent. Only `author_pr_prose` and `judge_pr_prose`
  cross the provider boundary between attempts, so no retry authors a commit, wires a missing effect,
  or reconciles a remote. These are `draft_pr_no-commits`, `draft_pr_skipped`,
  `draft_pr_lease-rejected`, and the five `*_effect_unavailable` reasons. Both halts are
  `needs-human`; recovery is the same — resolve the cited condition, then clear the HALT.
- `FINISH publication progress allowance exhausted after <N> transition(s); last transition: <transition>.
  Human review required.` — FINISH made verified publication progress, so none of the step retry
  budget was spent. The separate progress allowance reached its 14-transition bound (two passes over
  each of the seven publication transitions) before the publication state converged, and this is a
  `needs-human` halt. When the last prose transition follows a judged-deficient revision, the halt
  also ends with `Detail: <judge objection>`.
- A plain-prose sentence with no `FINISH publication …` prefix, e.g. `The PR prose judgment was
  refused and requires an operator decision. Next action: Review the refusal and decide how to
  continue publication.` and, when the provider supplied one, a trailing `Detail: <provider text>`.
  This is a `human_required` disposition — a condition only an operator can resolve, distinct from
  the three retryable/non-retryable shapes above. Its reasons cover judgment refusal or halt prose
  (`judgment_refused`, `judgment_halt_prose`), a PR that still carries a `needs-remediation` title
  prefix, banner, label, or body marker (`halt_state_pr` — resolved before judgment is ever
  dispatched, so no provider pass is spent), a publication transition that ran but left its owned
  state unchanged (`publication_transition_unmoved` — the detail names the transition and the
  state that did not move, whether the transition reported success or asked for a retry it could
  not perform), an unresolvable PR match or shipped record (`ambiguous_pr_identity`,
  `invalid_shipped_record`), and destructive or unrecognized publication intent
  (`interactive_intent_*`, `unattended_intent_*`). It is always a `needs-human` halt.

**Diagnosis:** inspect the named last transition and the preceding FINISH publication events in the
daemon log. Fourteen verified transitions without convergence means the publication state machine is
cycling or an external publication state is not settling; do not clear the HALT merely to repeat the
same cycle. An `author_pr_prose` / `judge_pr_prose` alternation means the authoring pass keeps
producing prose the judgment pass rejects. The `Detail:` text on a prose-related halt is the judgment
for the exact rejected revision; use it with the current PR body to correct the prose before resuming.

**Recovery:** reconcile the cited transition and the external PR/remote state until the next FINISH
entry can converge. Only then clear the HALT using [the resume
procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume).

An unrecognised reason always keeps its retries: the classifier fails closed toward retrying.

Clearing any FINISH publication halt is enough to get the feature back: see [a cleared FINISH halt
resumes to a recorded ship](#a-cleared-finish-halt-resumes-to-a-recorded-ship) for what the daemon
does next and how to confirm it. Never repair a halted FINISH by hand — an operator-opened PR is not
a harness finish, and the daemon has no way to learn about it.

#### The post-FINISH shipment audit refused the ship

**Symptom:** the daemon logs
`✋ <slug> false-ship halted — worktree kept (durable shipment evidence refused ship: <code> (expected <sha>, observed <sha>))`,
and `.pipeline/HALT` plus `.docs/halted/<slug>.md` carry the same sentence. The audit runs after
FINISH converges: it re-proves the durable `.docs/shipped/<slug>.md` record against the commit the
implementation PR will merge, and refuses every terminal ship side effect when that proof fails.

**Diagnosis:** the parenthesised pair is the whole diagnosis. `expected` is the head the PR reported
(`gh pr view <url> --json headRefOid`); `observed` is the commit the audit validated. The same pair
is on the event spine as `shipment_evidence_refused` and in
`.pipeline/audit-trail/events.jsonl`, so it stays readable after the branch moves on. For
`shipment-candidate-not-on-implementation-head` the two commits are unreachable from each other,
or the head's own tree carries no valid record — most often a record that was committed but never
pushed. Confirm with:

```bash
git -C .worktrees/<slug> show <expected-sha>:.docs/shipped/<slug>.md
```

A local branch that is merely *ahead* of the reported head is not a refusal on its own: the
conductor's post-finish cost refresh commits and pushes after publication, and GitHub updates a
pull request's head asynchronously, so the audit accepts that shape whenever the head it names
carries the record itself.

**Recovery:** push the record-bearing commit to the PR branch, then clear the HALT using [the resume
procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume). Never open or repair the PR by hand — see
[the manual-PR warning](#a-cleared-finish-halt-resumes-to-a-recorded-ship).

#### `draft_pr_lease-rejected`

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` reads
`FINISH publication cannot proceed: draft_pr_lease-rejected is not retryable — the remote branch
carries commits this checkout has never observed …`.

**Diagnosis:** `establish_pr` publishes the feature branch with
`git push -u origin <branch> --force-with-lease`, because the finish-time `rebase` step has just
rewritten that branch's history — the branch diverges from its own remote by construction, and a
plain push could never succeed. A rejected **lease** means something else: the remote branch carries
commits this worktree has never observed, so the push was refused rather than overwriting them.
(An ordinary transport or permission failure reports `draft_pr_push-failed` instead.)

```bash
git -C .worktrees/<slug> fetch origin <branch>
git -C .worktrees/<slug> log --oneline HEAD..origin/<branch>
```

- **Rows come back.** Real unseen work is on the remote. Integrate it (rebase the feature branch onto
  `origin/<branch>`, or reconcile by hand) before letting FINISH retry.
- **Empty.** The remote-tracking ref was merely stale; the fetch above refreshes the lease.

**Recovery:** once `HEAD..origin/<branch>` is empty, clear the HALT using
[the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume). Never resolve this with a bare
`git push --force` — that discards the very commits the lease protected.

#### `halt_marker`

The `pipeline` skill wrote `.pipeline/halt-user-input-required` — a genuine question that no
retry will answer. Its content becomes the stall question:

```bash
cat .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/halt-user-input-required
cat .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/build-stall-question.md
```

The build completion gate returns "not done" while that marker exists, so a surviving marker
also blocks the build gate directly.

#### `ENVIRONMENT_CLAIM_REFUTED`

A step failed with a reason beginning `ENVIRONMENT_CLAIM_REFUTED`. That is not an environment
problem: the dispatch made an operation-specific claim that the environment blocked `git push` or
`gh`, and the engine disproved it from the dispatch it actually performed (unsandboxed `claude`, and
a write fence whose generated script carries no such rule). The failure message quotes the claim and
states the facts.

Nothing needs fixing in the sandbox — do **not** go looking for one. The attempt is retried with the
disproof as its retry hint so the step performs the operation for real. If the same refutation
repeats until the budget is exhausted, the model is inventing the blocker rather than running the
command: escalate the step's model tier or take the finish over manually (a manual PR still needs
its `shipped-record`, see [shipped-record reconciliation](shipped-record-reconciliation.md)).

Claims from `codex` are never refuted — its unattended runs really are sandboxed
(`sandbox_mode="workspace-write"`), so a blocked operation there may be genuine.

A claim that the environment blocks all, every, or any Bash, shell, tool, or terminal command (or
blocks everything) also does not produce this marker. The audit passes that broader claim through
unchanged rather than selectively refuting a named operation in the same output.

#### Build-progress ceilings

A build that *is* resolving new tasks re-dispatches without consuming the fixed retry budget,
bounded by the `build_progress_halt` block. Defaults: enabled, `attempt_ceiling: 30`,
`dispatch_ceiling: 20`. Hitting the attempt ceiling parks with a distinct reason so you can tell
"genuinely stuck" apart from "still progressing but out of runway". Key details are in
[configuration](../reference/configuration.md).

A halt awaiting operator action is neither progress-re-kicked nor cleared by rate-limit episode
recovery; the daemon log names the blocking halt disposition.

The `▶ build <resolved>/<total>` line counts a task as resolved when its `.pipeline/task-status.json`
row reads `completed`/`skipped` **or** a commit on the branch carries its `Task: <id>` trailer — the
same union the build completion gate routes on. Nothing writes those rows back mid-build except the
`pipeline` skill's explicit `ai-conductor task done`, so on a run where the agent only stamps trailers the
rows stay `pending` and the trailers are what moves the number. A `resolved` count that does not
advance while `commitCount` keeps ticking therefore means work is landing without task attribution —
check the commit trailers before treating it as a stall.

#### Rate limits

A rate-limited dispatch emits `rate_limit` and waits — to the deadline parsed from the provider
message when one is available, otherwise 300 seconds. The wait does **not** burn the retry
budget. HALTs written while a rate-limit episode is active are stamped so they can be recovered
when the episode ends. A halt awaiting operator action is neither progress-re-kicked nor cleared by
episode recovery; the daemon log names the blocking halt disposition.

> **Known limitation.** The episode stamp is in-memory, scoped to the running daemon process.
> Restart the daemon during an episode and its episode-caused halts are no longer recognized as
> recoverable — they must be cleared by hand or by a base-branch advance.
> Tracked in [#1023](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1023).

#### Auth parks

`credentials_park` means the run is waiting on a credential source, not stuck on your code.
`credentials_park_progress` events report readiness probes as they happen. The park times out
after `harness_self_host.auth_park_timeout_minutes` (default 60), then HALTs with an actionable
reason naming the credential to refresh.

```bash
ai-conductor build-auth-status
```

Exit 0 means clean (`state=api-key` when there is no daemon-owned token, or `state=valid`).
Exit 1 covers `missing`, `unreadable`, `invalid`, and `unverifiable`, and prints the remediation
message with the token path.

#### Kickback loops

A gate that blocks routes work back to an earlier step. Each gate allows at most 2 kickbacks;
past that the run halts instead of looping. Separately, a kickback into `build` that ends with
zero net progress **and** an unchanged gate verdict escalates to a halt immediately rather than
spending the remaining budget. Read the verdict that keeps blocking:

```bash
cat .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/gates/<step>.json
```

The record is `{ satisfied, reason, checkedAt, kickback }`. `reason` is the exact string the
gate computed. The concepts behind gate verdicts are in [gates](../explanation/gates.md); the
per-step evidence files are listed in [artifacts](../reference/artifacts.md).

For a budget-cap halt, do not remove `HALT` or `HALT.class`. From the main checkout, inspect the
budget and authorize the intended recovery:

```bash
ai-conductor kickback-budget inspect --feature <slug>
ai-conductor kickback-budget raise --feature <slug> --gate <gate> --by <positive-integer> --rationale "<why more allowance is justified>"
# or
ai-conductor kickback-budget reset --feature <slug> --gate <gate> --rationale "<why this count may restart>"
```

The daemon clears only a live halt whose gate and generation match that one-use authorization. It
does so on its next loop iteration, without waiting for a base-branch advance. If the feature was
already operator-parked, unpark it after the command; otherwise it remains intentionally halted.
The full command contract is in the [CLI reference](../reference/cli.md#ai-conductor-kickback-budget).

#### BUILD verification after a repair

**Symptom:** a repair returned to BUILD and you need to determine whether `test_suite` reused
evidence or derived it again.

**Diagnosis:** read the feature narrative, not merely the old gate files:

```bash
ai-conductor daemon logs | grep 'BUILD member .* settled:'
```

The daemon writes `BUILD member test_suite settled: reuse (<basis>)` or `... recompute (<basis>)`.
`reuse (fingerprint-match)` reports still-valid full-suite evidence. A recompute line reports a
closed reason such as `fingerprint-mismatch` or `fresh-evidence-required`. A prior passing suite
result on disk is not a reason to skip the verifier; its current result decides satisfaction.

**Recovery:** do not create an operator park for the historical terminal-less stale-verdict path;
it is retired. The common stale-proof case re-dispatches `test_suite` automatically, so let the
re-verification round settle. If `build_review` instead HALTs `needs-human` because its inputs cannot
change, rewind from the feature worktree rather than editing pipeline state:

```bash
cd .worktrees/<slug>
ai-conductor rewind --to test_suite
```

`rewind` clears the affected gate verdicts and both halt markers only after it has atomically demoted
the feature to `test_suite`. It refuses a target that is not earlier than the recorded step. Do not
hand-edit `conduct-state.json`, gate files, `HALT`, or `HALT.class`.

**Verification:** the log contains one `test_suite` settle line, followed by `build_review` or an
explicit HALT. After a rewind, confirm it also prints
`Rewound to test_suite.` and that the next dispatch starts at `test_suite`.

#### Build review cannot resolve the feature plan

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` begins `build_review cannot resolve a plan for feature` and lists
candidate plan stems. Its class is `needs-human`; no provider was dispatched and no
`.pipeline/build-review.json` verdict was written.

**Diagnosis:** More than one plan exists, but neither a recorded active plan nor a plan whose stem
equals the feature slug identifies this feature's plan. Read the named candidates; do not select one
because of its alphabetical position.

**Recovery:** Restore or correct the feature's authoritative plan through the normal DECIDE process.
When several plan files remain, its filename stem must equal the feature slug. Then rerun the
preceding verifier from the feature worktree:

```bash
cd .worktrees/<slug>
ai-conductor rewind --to test_suite
```

`rewind` clears the halt and stale gate state atomically, then runs `test_suite` before a fresh
`build_review`. Do not delete the halt markers by hand or rename an unrelated plan to force a match.

**Verification:** The log shows `Rewound to test_suite.`, then a `test_suite` settle line followed
by `build_review`; the new review either has the resolved feature plan as input or reports an
independent gate result.

#### Full-suite verification lock remains occupied

**Symptom:** `test_suite` reports `Unable to acquire full-suite verification lock within 30000ms`.

**Diagnosis:** the verifier serializes suite execution with
`.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/test-suite.lock`. A dead lock owner is recovered automatically. If
that recovery was interrupted, its `recovery.json` claim is also reclaimed when its recorded process
is dead, or when unparseable claim bytes are at least five minutes old. A live claim and a fresh
unparseable claim remain exclusive.

**Recovery:** rerun the verification or let the daemon's next BUILD attempt run it. Do not delete
the lock directory or its claim: a live verifier may own it. If verification instead reports an
error naming a recovery claim, preserve the directory and diagnose the filesystem or process-probe
failure before retrying.

**Verification:** the next `test_suite` run either settles normally or reports its actual suite
failure; it does not remain blocked by a dead owner or reclaimable stale claim.

#### Setup failures

If the project's `bin/setup` failed inside the worktree, the feature may be quarantined:
`.pipeline/QUARANTINE` exists and a `wip/setup-quarantine-<slug>` branch holds the evidence.

#### Automatic setup-triage park

**Symptom:** a setup failure's triage ends with a retained worktree and a main-root marker at
`.daemon/parked/<slug>` whose first line begins `auto-parked:`. This is a durable automatic
park, not a missing dispatch or a transient in-memory daemon state.

**Diagnosis:** read the first line of `.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT` together with the
marker. The first line has one of three meanings:

- `feature parked — will not re-dispatch on the next scan` — the automatic marker was written
  (or was already present), so the daemon will keep the feature excluded.
- `feature errored — automatic park failed: …; run ai-conductor daemon park <slug>` — the marker
  could not be written. Repair the reported filesystem error, then park it explicitly before
  changing its worktree state.
- `feature errored — will re-dispatch on the next scan` — this was a non-park termination, so
  no automatic marker suppresses the next scan.

**Recovery:** fix the underlying setup problem first. Clear the feature's `HALT` and
`HALT.class` using [the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume), then remove
the automatic marker and restore dispatch eligibility:

```bash
ai-conductor daemon unpark <slug>
```

**Verification:** `test ! -e .daemon/parked/<slug>` succeeds. The next daemon scan logs
`↻ resume <slug>` or starts the feature, rather than another parked skip.

### 3. Re-verify SHIP evidence with `--diagnose`

`--diagnose` re-runs the SHIP-gating completion predicates — `test_suite`, `manual_test`,
`finish` — against the on-disk evidence and reports which ones cannot reproduce a pass.
It does not modify feature state.

```bash
ai-conductor inline --diagnose "<feature description>"
```

Run from the main checkout with the feature description, or from inside the worktree with no
description at all (`ai-conductor inline --diagnose`).

| Outcome | Output | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Evidence consistent | `State OK: … has consistent SHIP-phase evidence.` | 0 |
| No state for that description | `No conductor state found for "<desc>" — nothing to diagnose.` | 0 |
| Evidence gaps | Per-step gap report on stderr, plus remediation guidance | **1** |
| State says past `worktree` but no worktree exists | `Orphaned conductor state in <path>.` | **1** |

A non-zero exit here is the precise signal that the state is marked complete while the evidence
that would justify it is missing. That combination is what silently produced "complete" features
with no PR.

### 4. Read the run timeline with `--report`

```bash
ai-conductor inline --report
```

Read-only. Renders four tables from `.pipeline/events.jsonl` — Step Durations, Retry Hotspots,
Token Spend, and Kickbacks by Source Gate — then exits 0. An unreadable events log exits 1. Run
it from inside the worktree; it reads `.pipeline/` relative to the current directory.

> **Known limitation.** `--report` does not render halt tables, although `loop_halt`,
> `rebase_conflict_halt`, and `halt_marker_write_failed` persist in `events.jsonl`. For halt
> occurrences, use `cost-rollup.halts`, the shipped record's `## Cost`
> block, `ai-conductor kpi`, or the engineer-loop signal assembler; use `.pipeline/HALT` as the
> durable park state and `.pipeline/gates/<step>.json` for the gate verdict. Tracked in
> [#1023](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1023) and
> [#1008](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1008).

### 5. Read the daemon's own narrative

```bash
ai-conductor daemon logs --lines 200
```

`.daemon/daemon.log` carries every dispatch line, per-step result, engine warning, and the
startup dashboard snapshot.

> **Known limitation.** The log rotates to `.daemon/daemon.log.1` only when it is reopened and
> already exceeds 1 MB, and no CLI reads the rotated file. A long-running daemon never rotates
> mid-run; once it does, the previous history is only reachable by opening
> `.daemon/daemon.log.1` directly. Tracked in [#1008](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1008).

## Recovery

Pick the branch that matches the diagnosis. Every step says what it changes.

### The stall was a false negative — real work exists

The commits are on the branch but carry no `Task:` trailer, so the resolved-task count cannot
see them and the build completion gate keeps reporting those ids as pending. (The stall breaker
itself is not fooled — those commits move HEAD — but the count still drives the gate.)
Do not re-run the tasks. Make the work visible instead:

1. Confirm the commits exist and check their trailers:
   ```bash
   git -C .worktrees/<slug> log origin/<base-branch>..HEAD \
     --format='%h %s%n  Task: %(trailers:key=Task,valueonly)'
   ```
   Substitute your repository's default branch for `<base-branch>`. A blank `Task:` line means
   that commit is invisible to the stall breaker.
2. Flip the corresponding rows in `.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/task-status.json` to
   `"status": "completed"`. **What it changes:** the routing input for the build gate. A row
   already marked `completed` or `skipped` is preserved verbatim across every re-seed, so this
   edit survives.
3. Confirm the gate now sees them:
   ```bash
   ai-conductor inline --diagnose
   ```
   and re-read `.pipeline/gates/build.json` after the next dispatch — its `reason` should no
   longer list those task ids as pending.

`ai-conductor task done <id>` will not help here: it clears the `.pipeline/current-task` stamp and
never modifies `task-status.json`.

### The stall was real — the build genuinely cannot proceed

1. Read `.pipeline/build-stall-question.md` (or `.pipeline/halt-user-input-required`) and act on
   the question: fix the spec, the plan, or the code.
2. Remove the user-input marker if it is still present. **What it changes:** unblocks the build
   completion predicate, which returns "not done" while the file exists.
   ```bash
   rm -f .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/halt-user-input-required
   ```
3. Clear the halt (next section).

### The halt refused a DECIDE entry

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` begins `DECIDE entry refused` and `.pipeline/HALT.class` is
`needs-human`. The body names the source gate, requested target, evidence, and why autonomous entry
was refused. The daemon will not re-kick this class of halt.

**Recovery:** Read that body first. Correct an unknown target, missing artifact, or wrong routing before
authorizing anything. When the named DECIDE authoring pass is the intended operator decision, run these
commands from any directory inside the repository:

```bash
ai-conductor decide-grant --slug <slug> --step <target-from-HALT> \
  --reason "<why this one DECIDE entry is approved>"
rm -f .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT.class
```

The first command resolves the main checkout and writes a durable grant for only that target into its
daemon-owned `.daemon/grants/<slug>.json`. Outside a repository, it refuses without recording a
grant. The conductor consumes it immediately before provider dispatch, so it cannot authorize another
DECIDE step or a later retry.

**Never hand-write a grant file.** The grant deliberately lives outside the feature worktree: a
`decide-grant.json` written inside `.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/` authorizes nothing, because that
directory is the build agent's own scratch space and an agent must not be able to authorize itself.
Use the command from any directory inside the repository; it resolves the main checkout itself.

**`plan` is never grantable.** `ai-conductor decide-grant --step plan` exits non-zero, and the entry
policy refuses `plan` before consulting any grant. If the HALT names `plan` as the requested target,
the correct recovery is to drive the plan revision yourself — interactively, with `/conduct` or by
editing the plan — and then clear the halt so the feature resumes into BUILD. See
[the plan-revision recovery](#a-halt-requests-a-plan-revision) below.

**Clearing the HALT alone does not authorize entry.** Without a valid matching grant, the next poll
writes the same `needs-human` HALT and launches no provider. A grant for `stories`, for example, does
not authorize `architecture_review`.

**Verification:** After the daemon resumes, confirm the one-use artifact was consumed and then inspect
the result of the named step:

```bash
test ! -e .daemon/grants/<slug>.json
ai-conductor daemon logs | grep '\[<slug>\]'
```

### A halt requests a plan revision

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` is `needs-human` and names `plan` as the requested target — typically
from a `remediate` or `build_review` disposition asking for a DECIDE revision.

**There is no grant for this.** The daemon may not re-plan under any authorization. Recover by hand:

1. Read the halt body and the remediation that produced it
   (`.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/remediation.json`) to see which plan change is actually being asked
   for. Verify the request against the gate evidence — a remediation whose fix would re-trigger the
   gate that caused it is wrong, and amending the plan to match it makes things worse.
2. Make the plan edit yourself in the feature worktree. When BUILD discovered that an approved DECIDE
   assertion must change, add the correction beside the original rather than rewriting it — see
   [amendment requests](#amendment-requests) above. Story artifacts under `.docs/stories/` are the
   exception: replace the superseded assertion in place instead, with no amendment note.
3. Rewind so the feature resumes into BUILD and actually builds the revised plan, from inside the
   feature worktree:
   ```bash
   cd .worktrees/<slug> && ai-conductor rewind --to build
   ```
   [`ai-conductor rewind`](../reference/cli.md#ai-conductor-rewind) marks `build` and every later
   non-skipped step stale, clears their gate verdicts, and clears `HALT` and `HALT.class` atomically.
   Do not delete the halt markers by hand: that leaves the already-recorded `build`, `test_suite`,
   and `build_review` verdicts standing, so the revised plan task is never built. If the plan you
   edited is sealed — any plan amended after first BUILD entry is — reseal it first, per
   [the protected-artifact recovery](#the-halt-is-a-protected-artifact-violation).

If the feature is parked while you do this, unpark it last — the daemon re-dispatches as soon as it
is eligible.

If the grant remains, the feature did not enter the authorized step; re-read the HALT rather than
clearing it again.

### The halt is a plan gap

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT.class` is `plan-gap`. `prd_audit` or the as-built architecture review
found an outcome the shipped work does not deliver and no active plan task owns the repair. The
approved design is the ceiling here: the daemon retains this halt on every sweep, and clearing the
marker without amending an artifact just re-halts on the same criterion. A committed record of the
halt is on the feature branch at `.docs/halted/<slug>.md`; clearing the halt flips its status to
resolved.

**Blast radius:** the amendment rewrites committed DECIDE artifacts on the feature branch and
re-runs BUILD and every later step. Nothing outside the feature moves.

1. Read the gap. `.pipeline/prd-audit.md` (its per-criterion detail section) or
   `.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md` (its `## Recorded Findings`) names each criterion and
   why no active plan task owns the repair.
2. Amend the artifact the gap actually indicts, in the feature worktree — usually the plan (add a
   task naming the omitted work), sometimes the story (when the criterion overpromises what the
   approved design can deliver). Update the feature's coherence table task and criterion rows in the
   same commit, and commit inside the worktree.
3. Reseal the amended protected paths from the main repository checkout, not the worktree — a plan
   or story committed after first BUILD entry leaves the seal baseline stale:
   ```bash
   ai-conductor reseal --slug <slug> --path <path> [--path <path> ...] \
     --reason "<why this amendment is approved>"
   ```
   [`ai-conductor reseal`](../reference/cli.md#ai-conductor-reseal) is TTY-only by design; run it
   interactively. See [the protected-artifact recovery](#the-halt-is-a-protected-artifact-violation)
   for what it checks.
4. Rewind, from inside the feature worktree:
   ```bash
   cd .worktrees/<slug> && ai-conductor rewind --to build
   ```
   [`ai-conductor rewind`](../reference/cli.md#ai-conductor-rewind) marks `build` and every later
   non-skipped step stale, clears their gate verdicts, and clears `HALT` and `HALT.class` atomically.
   Clearing the markers by hand instead leaves `build`, `test_suite`, and `build_review` recorded as
   done, so the amended plan task is never built.

**Two plan gaps need no artifact amendment:**

- **The gap is reader-facing documentation the plan deliberately delegated to the
  `maintain-documentation` gating step.** That step runs `after: rebase`, downstream of the audit
  that blocks on the criterion, so it can never clear its own gap. Make the documentation edits by
  hand — documentation pages are not protected artifacts, so no reseal is needed — then clear the
  halt by renaming:
  ```bash
  mv .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT.cleared
  rm -f .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT.class
  ```
- **The gap needs machinery another, unmerged feature owns.** Leave this feature halted and sequence
  the two. Amending this feature's plan to build the other feature's deliverable is wrong.

**How to confirm:** the next dispatch re-enters BUILD rather than re-writing the same halt, and the
audit that raised the gap passes its criterion on the following lap. `git show
<feature-branch>:.docs/halted/<slug>.md` reads `Status: resolved`.

### The remediation planner disagreed with the parsed findings

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT.class` is `needs-human` — not `plan-gap` — and the detail reads:

```text
Validation group "prd_audit" halted: needs human DECIDE — As-built review remediation
planner findings do not exactly match parsed REMEDIABLE findings. Unexpected: S2.4.
```

The remediation planner proposes one gap per finding, and the engine requires that set to match the
admitted findings exactly: each one bound either to an as-built `REMEDIABLE` row or to a `prd_audit`
finding. The three words name which way it diverged:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Unexpected: <id>` | The planner proposed remediation for an id that is in neither admitted set. |
| `Missing: <id>` | An admitted finding the planner proposed nothing for. |
| `Duplicate: <id>` | The planner proposed the same finding more than once. |

**`Unexpected` on a criterion id is the common case, and it is a plan gap.** A criterion graded
`PLAN_GAP` in `.pipeline/prd-audit.md` is unmet with no active task owning it, so it is not an
admitted finding — but it reads to the planner like work to schedule, and the planner writes tasks
for it. Compare the `FIXABLE` rows in the same table: those carry a parent task and are admitted.

Watch for one defect graded by both gates. In the example above, the as-built review's only
`REMEDIABLE` finding said the same thing as `S2.4` — a story outcome with no runtime path that can
produce it — so the planner reasonably wrote a single remediation covering both, and the exact-match
check refused it. When the two gates indict one defect, that is a signal the **story** overpromises
what the approved design delivers, not that the plan is missing a task.

**Recover through [the plan-gap recovery](#the-halt-is-a-plan-gap)** — read the gap, amend the
artifact it indicts (usually the story here), update the coherence rows in the same commit, reseal,
then `ai-conductor rewind --to build`. `Missing` and `Duplicate` are planner faults rather than plan
gaps: no artifact is wrong, so re-dispatch the step and let the planner re-run against the same
findings.

### An all-REMEDIABLE as-built review did not route

**Symptom:** the `architecture_review_as_built` HALT says `remediation did not route:` and then
names one of these causes: remediation is disabled, the run is not in daemon mode, or the planner
did not write a usable remediation plan. The HALT also lists the `REMEDIABLE` blocking findings.

**Diagnosis:** read `.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md` for the finding details. If the
cause names the planner, inspect `.pipeline/remediation.json`: it may be absent, stale, invalid JSON,
missing a `dispositions` array, or contain no routable disposition. A `DESIGN` finding is different:
it requires a human decision and names its governing clause instead of this routing cause.

**Recovery:** enable `architecture_review_as_built.remediation.enabled` and re-run in daemon mode
when those are the stated causes. Otherwise correct the remediation output so it is current JSON
with at least one routable disposition for the listed finding, then use the [resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume).

**Verification:** the next dispatch either routes the repair work or writes a HALT with a new,
specific cause; it must not repeat the same cause after its input has been corrected.

### Worktree preparation failed to install the preventive git hook

**Symptom:** the worktree step halts with `preventive git hook installation failed: <reason>` — for
example `unable to inspect .git metadata`, `unable to access .git metadata`, or a `writeFile`/git-config
error. This is deliberately fail-closed: a worktree with a `.git` present must have the
`.pipeline/git-hooks/pre-commit` protected-artifact gate installed and wired before BUILD/SHIP can
dispatch into it, so a broken installation halts the run rather than proceeding without the gate. See
[settings and hooks](../reference/settings-and-hooks.md#git-hooks) for what the hook does.

Diagnose the underlying filesystem or git-config failure named in `<reason>` — a permissions problem on
`.git` or `.pipeline/git-hooks/`, a full disk, or a `git config --worktree` failure are the usual causes.
Fix it, then clear the HALT and let the daemon re-dispatch; worktree preparation retries the write on the
next attempt. A worktree with no `.git` at all is unaffected — that shape has no commit surface to
protect and is skipped as a no-op.

### The halt is a protected-artifact violation

Do not delete or edit `.pipeline/protected-artifact-seal.json`. The engine rebaselines a stale seal
automatically after a clean engine rebase, or during verification when it proves that every changed
artifact is byte-identical to the base-branch tip or a recorded remediation append extends a
fingerprint-verified sealed baseline.

**First, identify an amendment request.** If the halt arose because BUILD discovered that an accepted
DECIDE assertion must change, do not amend or reseal it in BUILD. Route the feature back to its owning
DECIDE step (the daemon reaches the existing operator gate). There, add the correction beside the
original assertion before BUILD starts again:

```markdown
> **Amended YYYY-MM-DD by #NNN:** <what the assertion now says, and why>
```

The note is additive: retain the original text and create no separate record. Story artifacts under
`.docs/stories/` are the exception: replace the superseded assertion in place with no amendment note.

**Annotate history-shaped artifacts; rewrite state-shaped ones.** The additive-note rule above is
for artifacts that downstream machinery reads as *history* — a plan's executed tasks are the ledger
`prd_audit`'s `FIXABLE` findings match against, so deleting one orphans its diff. But
`prd_audit` and the as-built architecture review re-judge the stories' acceptance criteria, the PRD's
functional requirements when one exists, and the component diagram as *current state*, comparing what
the artifact states verbatim against the shipped implementation. An amendment note asking the reader to
substitute new meaning leaves the stated requirement contradicting the code, and every downstream
re-judgement risks a finding. For state-shaped artifacts, rewrite the statement outright and keep a
one-line dated provenance marker. (Precedent: the 2026-08-14 wiring-rubric retirement — the
rewritten FR-1 and diagram passed `prd_audit` all-`PASS` on the first pass; the earlier
annotation-only draft would have shipped an FR still claiming five rubrics.) Re-author the plan
without a task targeting the other feature's sealed artifact, then run
`ai-conductor plan-protected-targets .docs/plans/<feature>.md` before landing. A clean result is
`No protected-target violations found.`; each violation is reported as `Task <id>: <path> —
return this amendment to DECIDE; BUILD tasks must not target protected artifacts.`

1. Read the refusal in `.daemon/daemon.log`:
   ```bash
   ai-conductor daemon logs | grep 'Protected artifact rotation refused'
   ```
2. Inspect the named path and act on the specific reason:
   - `Uncommitted protected artifact changed: <path>` — a workspace edit that was never committed.
     Restore the file from `HEAD`.
   - `Protected artifact changed: <path>` with a `Feature-authored committed change` cause — revert
     to the committed DECIDE content and route any actual amendment to DECIDE.
   - `Unvouched engine remediation append: <path>` — a recorded remediation-task heading is present,
     but the committed content is not an exact append of either the base-tip or fingerprint-verified
     sealed content. Review the named content and the reported operator-reseal and engine-append exits;
     do not treat it as the ordinary feature-authored revert case.
   - `Protected artifact provenance undeterminable: <path>` — the base ref could not be resolved, no
     merge-base exists between `HEAD` and the base branch, or the inheritance probe (`git diff`)
     failed. Supply the base ref, or rebase onto the base branch to establish shared history, then
     retry.
   - Anything else — resolve the reported baseline/base-tip lookup failure. A safe inherited
     base-branch change (including one where the base has since moved past what this feature's last
     rebase brought in, as long as this feature never touched the path) needs no manual seal repair;
     the next sanctioned rebase or verification rotates it.
3. Clear `HALT` and `HALT.class` using the next procedure. If the cause remains, verification
   refuses again before dispatch.

**The edit is intentional and operator-approved (e.g. a feature's plan or architecture was amended
mid-build after the first BUILD seal was created).** The committed amendment makes the existing
seal baseline stale. The engine has no automatic path for this — a feature-authored change never
rotates on its own, by design, so there is no default action to take here without a human reading
the diff first. Do not hand-edit `.pipeline/protected-artifact-seal.json` (malformed JSON or a wrong
fingerprint silently breaks verification for every other artifact in the seal). Instead, review the
diff, commit the amendment, and only after approving it, run
[`ai-conductor reseal`](../reference/cli.md#ai-conductor-reseal) from the main repository checkout so it
recomputes real fingerprints instead of guessing at them:

```bash
ai-conductor reseal \
  --slug <feature-slug> \
  --path <path under .docs/... that was reviewed and approved> \
  --reason "<why this amendment is approved>" \
  --clear-halt
```

Repeat `--path` for each amended file. The command only runs from an interactive operator terminal —
it refuses under a step subprocess or any non-TTY invocation — and refuses the whole reseal if any
protected path outside the given `--path` list has also drifted, so it cannot be used to launder
unrelated changes into the seal. On success it writes a new baseline at the current commit, appends a
`rebaselines` entry recording the trigger (`operator-reseal`) and rationale, and writes a
`protected_artifact_reseal` audit record with an `operator` origin — so the override is auditable
rather than silent. `--clear-halt` also clears the worktree's HALT in the same step, once its class is
the protected-artifact class — see
[operator-authorized protected-artifact reseals](../explanation/gates.md#operator-authorized-protected-artifact-reseals).

The reseal survives later rebaselines. When the base branch subsequently moves and the seal rebaselines
onto the feature's new merge base, a resealed path is no longer refused as a feature-authored DECIDE
change: it is kept at its approved content and reported as `kept operator-resealed paths: <path>` in
the daemon log. That approval is bound to the content it was taken against, not to the path — amend the
artifact again after resealing and it refuses exactly as before, because the sealed fingerprint no
longer matches. Reseal again only after reviewing the new amendment.

If REKICK encounters this refusal before starting git, the HALT begins
`protected-artifact seal error` and explicitly says no rebase is active. Do not use the rebase
resolver or run `git rebase --continue`; review and rotate the seal as above, then clear the HALT
and re-queue.

### The completed rebase halted for missing feature content

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` is `needs-human` and begins `rebase completed — parked for human
review`. Its reason lists up to three missing commit subjects, each with its abbreviated pre-rebase
identity and the failed content evidence; a suffix states how many further subjects were omitted.
The rebase has already completed, so do not run `git rebase --continue`.

The rebase work-preservation guard requires every pre-rebase commit subject to survive the replay.
A commit legitimately vanishes when the base already carries its work: the replay empties it and
Git discards it. That happens whenever the same fix lands independently on `main` first — the
feature's own copy conflicts, the resolver settles it in the base's favour, and nothing remains to
commit.

The guard therefore checks each vanished commit's intent before reporting loss: every line it added
must be present in `HEAD`, and no line it removed may be back (counted against the commit's own
parent, so a structural line like `});` surviving elsewhere in the file does not count as restored).
A commit whose work is genuinely absent and cleanly re-appliable still halts.

**Recovery:** park the feature, review the named evidence, and restore any missing work:

```bash
ai-conductor daemon park <slug>
cd .worktrees/<slug>
git show ORIG_HEAD -- <path>   # inspect the named pre-rebase content
git status                     # must be clean before clearing the halt
```

If the evidence is correct, restore the missing feature content from `ORIG_HEAD`, commit the repair,
and confirm the working tree is clean. If the content is already present through an equivalent base
change, verify that equivalence before clearing the halt. Then remove both live halt files, verify
they are absent, and unpark as described in [A completed rebase still appears halted](#a-completed-rebase-still-appears-halted).

### A completed rebase still appears halted

**Symptom:** `git rebase --continue` completed successfully, but the dashboard still lists the
feature under HALTED and both `.pipeline/HALT` and `.pipeline/HALT.class` remain. Manual Git
commands complete the rebase; they do not reconcile the daemon's pipeline markers.

1. Park the feature before inspecting or changing its git state:
   ```bash
   ai-conductor daemon park <slug>
   ```
   Keep it parked through marker cleanup and verification. Do not unpark before clearing the stale
   halt; that makes the feature dispatchable while its recovery state is inconsistent.
2. From the feature worktree, prove that no rebase is active and the checkout is clean:
   ```bash
   cd .worktrees/<slug>
   git status
   test ! -d "$(git rev-parse --git-path rebase-merge)"
   test ! -d "$(git rev-parse --git-path rebase-apply)"
   test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"
   ```
   Stop if either rebase state directory exists, `git status` reports a rebase, or the porcelain
   output is non-empty. Finish and verify the rebase before removing any marker.
3. Return to the main checkout and remove both live halt files:
   ```bash
   cd ../..
   rm -f .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT.class
   ```
   Removing only `HALT` leaves a stale classification sidecar and does not complete recovery.
4. Verify that the rebase state directories and both live halt files are absent, then unpark:
   ```bash
   test ! -d "$(git -C .worktrees/<slug> rev-parse --git-path rebase-merge)"
   test ! -d "$(git -C .worktrees/<slug> rev-parse --git-path rebase-apply)"
   test ! -e .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT
   test ! -e .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT.class
   ai-conductor daemon unpark <slug>
   ```

The next dashboard snapshot should list the feature under ELIGIBLE or IN-PROGRESS rather than
PARKED or HALTED. The daemon log should show `↻ resume <slug>` after dispatch.

### Clear a halt and let the feature resume

**Blast radius:** clearing the halt makes the feature eligible for dispatch again on the next
poll. Fix the cause first, or it halts again immediately.

#### OVER_SCOPE decision halt

If `HALT.class` is `over-scope`, do not clear the body unchanged. Edit the fenced
`over-scope-decisions` JSON array in `.pipeline/HALT`: for each decision you are making, set
`decision` to `accept` or `refuse` and add a non-empty `rationale`. Leave entries you are not
deciding as `pending`. An accept clears that criterion; a refusal records the decision but keeps
the halt active as “refused — rework required.”

Then clear by **renaming** the edited body to `.pipeline/HALT.cleared` — never `rm -f` it. The
next prd_audit lap harvests your decisions from `HALT.cleared` and from nowhere else, so deleting
the body silently discards every decision you just authored and the feature re-halts with the
same blocking set:

```bash
mv .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT.cleared
rm -f .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT.class
```

**What it changes:** the daemon registers a filesystem watcher on each halted feature's marker
and wakes when it is cleared, so removal is the resume signal. Filesystem events are the fast
path; the watcher also polls (every second by default), so a clear that lands before the watcher
is ready — or an event the OS drops — is still picked up within one poll interval. (With
`--no-watch` the daemon relies on its own polling loop instead; it still picks the feature up,
just on the next poll.)

**How to confirm:** the next dashboard snapshot lists the slug under ELIGIBLE or IN-PROGRESS
rather than HALTED, and the log shows `↻ resume <slug>`.

### A cleared FINISH halt resumes to a recorded ship

**Blast radius:** none beyond the feature. Clearing the halt re-enters FINISH; the coordinator
re-observes every publication boundary and performs only the transitions still outstanding.

Clear the halt with [the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume). Nothing else
is required, and nothing should be repaired by hand:

- The daemon re-dispatches the feature even when `.docs/shipped/<slug>.md` is already committed on
  its branch. That record is written by the mid-sequence `write_shipped_record` transition, so on its
  own it proves one transition ran, not that the ship completed. The shipped-record dedup therefore
  skips a candidate only when FINISH **recorded its outcome** (`.pipeline/finish-choice` in the
  worktree) or the worktree is already gone. A retained worktree with no outcome record is resumed.
- FINISH authors the PR prose itself. If the body is still the engine-seeded placeholder, the
  coordinator dispatches its `author_pr_prose` pass with the branch diff and the feature's spec
  artifacts; you do not need to write the body.
- The resumed run records the outcome, enrolls the PR in `.daemon/mergeable-watch.jsonl`, and the
  mergeable sweep reaps the worktree after the shipped record is proven on the default branch.

**How to confirm:** the daemon log shows `re-dispatch <slug>: shipped record is on this feature's
branch but FINISH recorded no outcome …`, then the FINISH publication transitions, and finally the
enrollment. If it instead logs `skip <slug>: shipped dedup — … awaiting the human merge`, FINISH
*did* record an outcome (`.pipeline/finish-choice` exists) — the work really is complete and waiting
on your merge.

### An auth park timed out

Refresh the credential the halt body names, then clear the halt as above. Re-check with
`ai-conductor build-auth-status` before clearing — a halt cleared against a still-broken
credential just re-parks and burns the timeout again.

### A rate-limit episode is in progress

Do nothing. The wait is deliberate and does not consume the retry budget. If you must stop the
daemon during an episode, see
[emergency stop a running feature](emergency-stop-a-running-feature.md) — and note that halts
raised during the episode will not be auto-recovered by the replacement process.

### Codex could not create a process for its shell tool calls

The dispatch output names the failure directly:

```text
Codex could not create a process for 4 shell tool calls (its tool router reported
`exec_command failed ... CreateProcess`).
```

Codex sandboxes each shell tool call inside its own bubblewrap namespace. When the host denies
that namespace, every `exec_command` is rejected while Codex itself still exits 0 and still
answers. The engine now classifies such a dispatch as a failure rather than a result, so a
`build_review` rubric that could not run `git diff` reports an infrastructure failure instead of a
hollow PASS.

**Diagnose the host, not the feature.** Confirm the sandbox can create a namespace:

```bash
bwrap --unshare-user --ro-bind / / /bin/true; echo "exit=$?"
sysctl kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns
```

A non-zero exit, or the restriction enabled while the daemon already runs inside a namespace,
means Codex has no way to spawn a shell there. Until the host grants it, route the affected steps
to another provider; clearing the halt alone re-runs into the same denial.

### build_review has a scope-incomplete candidate

**Symptom:** `build_review` reports a mechanical fault whose cause is `scope-incomplete`; after the
shared mechanical-fault allowance is exhausted, `.pipeline/HALT` names `testQuality` and
`scope-incomplete`. The diagnostic identifies the concrete candidate, its available marker/obligation
evidence, and the evidence that remains missing.

**Diagnosis:** this is not an instruction to add a test merely because a test path appears in the plan,
and it is not a test-insensitive finding. The engine already formed a frozen, feature-local candidate
from a changed declaration with an ambiguous `Covers` association or from identified changed
setup/helper evidence affecting an opted-in test or group. The reviewer returned a valid
`indeterminate` scope resolution. Any valid findings from the same review remain in
`.pipeline/build-review.json`; a scope fault does not discard them.

**Recovery:** resolve the named ambiguity with source evidence where possible. The operator may supply
a scope clarification, authorize a binding or evidence correction within the approved work, or authorize
separately scoped analyzer work. Do not create speculative plan tasks, add a marker solely to silence the
fault, or retry unchanged indeterminacy indefinitely. If the shared allowance is exhausted and the
operator explicitly accepts reduced test-quality coverage, use the reduced-coverage procedure below for
the named `testQuality` rubric and lap, then clear the halt. That acceptance suppresses only the derived
scope fault: address any retained test-quality finding through its normal disposition or repair path.

**Verification:** the next review either contains a complete candidate resolution or renders the
operator's reduced-coverage decision. A valid finding from the original result is still listed and still
blocks unless independently repaired or accepted.

### build_review halted on an exhausted mechanical fault allowance

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` reads:

```text
build_review mechanical fault allowance exhausted: <consumed> of 3 shared faults consumed.
Current lap <lap>: <rubric> closed cause <reason> (<detail>).
1. Record a reduced-coverage decision: ai-conductor build-review record-reduced-coverage --feature <slug> --lap <lap> --rubric <rubric> --rationale "<rationale>".
2. Clear the documented terminal state: rm -f .pipeline/HALT .pipeline/HALT.class.
```

When the current lap has no readable aggregate (for example, its verdict came from an earlier
lap and the completion guard scored it `absent`), the halt instead reads:

```text
build_review mechanical fault allowance exhausted: <consumed> of 3 shared faults consumed; current-lap diagnostic is unavailable; Last recorded fault: <rubric> closed cause <reason> on lap <lap> (<detail>).
```

naming the ledger's `lastMechanicalFault` record — the most recent rubric/reason/lap the
allowance was actually charged against — instead of the numbered recovery steps. Recovery is the
same: record reduced coverage for the named rubric and lap, then clear the halt.

Both forms carry class `needs-human` — deliberately, so the daemon's automatic re-kick sweep does
not clear it on its own.

**Diagnosis:** a `build_review` rubric repeatedly produced either an infrastructure failure (a tool
crash, a `git diff` that could not run, or a provider outage) or a valid `scope-incomplete` outcome
from an indeterminate concrete candidate. Mechanical faults draw from a bounded allowance shared across
`build_review` kickbacks (3 faults), tracked separately from the ordinary semantic kickback budget so an
infrastructure blip or unresolved scope cannot be laundered into a hollow PASS or an endless kickback
loop. The allowance resets only on demonstrated progress (a rebase or base-branch advance), not on a
bare retry.

**Recovery:** the halt body names both required steps.

1. Record the decision — this requires an interactive terminal and a resolvable local operator
   identity; it derives the closed infrastructure cause itself, so it refuses if the rubric is
   not currently an exhausted infrastructure failure or `scope-incomplete` outcome (already judged, unknown rubric, allowance
   not actually exhausted, a duplicate reduced-coverage record, or the lap/review has since gone
   stale):
   ```bash
   ai-conductor build-review record-reduced-coverage --feature <slug> --lap <lap> \
     --rubric <rubric> --rationale "<why this rubric's coverage is being reduced>"
   ```
   This only writes the decision — it does not touch the halt marker.
2. Clear the halt using [the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume).

**Verification:** the next `build_review` run treats the named fault as reduced coverage rather than
halting on the same infrastructure failure or `scope-incomplete` outcome, the feature can reach PASS,
and the shipped record at `.docs/shipped/<slug>.md` carries a reduced-coverage section for that rubric.
A genuine semantic FAIL on the same rubric still blocks exactly as before — recording reduced coverage
does not suppress a real finding.

**The record stops the halt, not the dispatch.** An excused rubric is still dispatched on every
later lap and can still report the same infrastructure failure or scope-incomplete outcome; what
changes is that the named fault no longer halts the run. Expect to keep seeing the corresponding
build-review fault events in `.pipeline/events.jsonl`. That is not a sign the record failed to take;
confirm the record itself in `.pipeline/build-review-dispositions.json`.

### Remediation supplied no recognized disposition

**Symptom:** `.pipeline/HALT` begins with `remediation planner returned no recognized
disposition:` and `.pipeline/HALT.class` reads `needs-human`. The remainder names every dropped
gap as `<gap-id> → "<disposition>"` and gives the accepted vocabulary.

**Diagnosis:** inspect `.pipeline/remediation.json`. Each listed gap has a missing, non-string, or
unrecognized `disposition`, so the engine rejects it instead of silently treating it as build work.
It emits one `remediation_disposition_rejected` event per rejected gap to both
`.pipeline/events.jsonl` and `.pipeline/audit-trail/events.jsonl`. A mixed remediation plan still
routes its recognized gaps; only the rejected entries are dropped and reported.

**Recovery:** correct the remediation output so every intended gap uses one of the accepted
dispositions named in the halt, then clear the halt using
[the resume procedure](#clear-a-halt-and-let-the-feature-resume). Do not clear the halt first:
the unchanged remediation output will halt again.

**Verification:** the next run either routes the recognized remediation work or halts for the
documented reason belonging to a valid `halt` disposition. The rejected-disposition event is absent
unless the corrected plan still contains an invalid entry.

### Remediation names an evidence-complete owning task

**Symptom:** a remediation `build` disposition names an existing plan task whose prior `Task:`
trailer or task-status row says it is complete.

**Diagnosis:** this is valid remediation work, not a terminal no-work condition. The conductor
persists a repair obligation with the finding, owning task, and the current commit boundary; it
then re-stages that task and returns to BUILD. Earlier completion evidence cannot close this repair.

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
d = json.load(open('.worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/remediation.json'))
for x in d['dispositions']:
    print(x['id'], x['disposition'], '|', x['rationale'][:120])
"
```

**Recovery:** normally, take no operator action. Let BUILD address the finding and record current
completion evidence. If the run halts instead, use the stated refusal: an unreadable repair state,
an unavailable post-admission commit boundary, or a task-status re-stage failure needs repair before
the feature resumes. Do not clear a halt merely to retry unchanged state.

A halt reading `remediation produced no dispatchable build work; the implicated task(s) are already
evidence-complete` on a feature that plainly has an open obligation used to mean the obligation was
being ignored: repair state was keyed on `engine-state.json`'s `activePlanPath`, which only the
interactive plan step ever writes, so a daemon-dispatched, spec-landed feature had none and the old
`Task:` trailer re-closed the re-staged task. Repair reads now resolve the plan through the same
ladder the obligation writer uses (recorded path, then the slug-scoped convention). If the plan
cannot be resolved at all while obligations exist, the refusal says `no active plan could be
resolved` — restore the feature's `.docs/plans/<slug>.md` (its stem must equal the feature slug)
rather than clearing the halt.

**Verification:** the named task is dispatched in BUILD, and the repair closes only after current
evidence and the governing review pass. A later, distinct finding creates a new repair boundary;
restarting the conductor replays an admitted open repair rather than treating the earlier completion
as sufficient.

### The feature must stop being dispatched entirely

```bash
ai-conductor daemon park <slug>
```

**What it changes:** writes `.daemon/parked/<slug>` at the main repo root, which is checked
before every dispatch and first in the re-kick sweep. Full procedure and the ordering rules are
in [emergency stop a running feature](emergency-stop-a-running-feature.md).

## Verification

1. **No live halt marker remains** for a feature you intended to resume:
   ```bash
   ls .worktrees/<slug>/.pipeline/HALT 2>/dev/null || echo "no halt"
   ```
2. **SHIP evidence re-verifies** — from inside the worktree:
   ```bash
   ai-conductor inline --diagnose
   ```
   Expect exit 0 and `State OK:`. A non-zero exit still names the failing steps.
3. **The blocking gate now passes.** Re-read `.pipeline/gates/<step>.json` after the next
   dispatch: `satisfied` must be `true` and `checkedAt` must be newer than the halt you cleared.
4. **The task count moves.** After the next build attempt, the resolved-task count in
   `.pipeline/task-status.json` (unioned with `Task:` trailers) must be strictly higher than it
   was, and the log must not repeat `build_stall`.
5. **The feature reaches a terminal outcome.** The daemon log shows `■ done <slug>: done` with a
   PR link, not another `halted`/`error` line.

If the feature ships but the daemon keeps re-dispatching it, the shipped record is missing —
see [shipped record reconciliation](shipped-record-reconciliation.md).
