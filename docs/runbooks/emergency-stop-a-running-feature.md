# Emergency stop a running feature

Stop one feature — or the whole daemon — mid-flight without corrupting state. For operators
who need to halt work already in progress and then touch git state safely.

> **Not sure this is the right runbook?** Run `/daemon-triage` — it gathers the evidence
> read-only, classifies the failure, and routes to the one runbook that owns it.

The order is not negotiable: **park, then stop, then touch git.** Every step below states what
it changes on disk and how to confirm it landed.

## Symptom

One of these is true:

- A feature is building the wrong thing, or its spec is wrong, and you want it to stop now.
- A build is burning budget with no visible progress and you want it out of the rotation.
- You need to delete, move, or rewrite a feature's branch or worktree.
- The daemon is dispatching work you did not intend and you want the whole loop to stand down.

## Diagnosis

### Identify the slug

Every daemon-side artifact for a feature is keyed by its **slug**, which is the plan file stem:
`.docs/plans/<slug>.md` → slug `<slug>`. The build worktree is `.worktrees/<slug>` and its
branch is `feat/daemon-<slug>`.

```bash
ls .docs/plans/
git worktree list
```

### Find out what is actually running

```bash
ai-conductor daemon status
ai-conductor daemon logs --lines 60
```

`daemon status` sweeps the project registry and prints one badge line per repo. `● running`
means a live daemon owns `.daemon/daemon.pid` and can dispatch; anything else means it cannot.
The full state vocabulary is in [daemon recovery](daemon-recovery.md).

The startup dashboard in `.daemon/daemon.log` groups every known slug into exactly one of
PARKED, HALTED, PROCESSED, IN-PROGRESS, GATED, WAITING, ELIGIBLE. PARKED has absolute
precedence — a parked slug never appears anywhere else.

### Decide the scope

- **One feature, daemon keeps running** → park the slug (Recovery step 1) and stop there.
- **Everything, temporarily** → park the slug you care about, then pause the daemon.
- **Everything, and you are about to rewrite git state** → park, pause, then stop.

## Recovery

### 1. Park the feature first

```bash
ai-conductor daemon park <slug>
```

**What it changes:** writes `.daemon/parked/<slug>` under the *main* repo root. The command
resolves that root itself via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, so it works from inside any
worktree. It validates the slug first: if neither `.docs/plans/<slug>.md` nor
`.worktrees/<slug>` exists it prints `error: slug '<slug>' not found under <root> …` and exits 1
without writing anything.

**How to confirm:**

```bash
ls .daemon/parked/
```

Run that from the main checkout — `.daemon/` lives at the main repo root, not in the worktree.
Success prints `Parked '<slug>' — it will not be dispatched or re-kicked until unparked.` plus
the marker path. Re-parking an already-parked slug is a no-op that prints
`'<slug>' is already parked (originally parked at <timestamp>) — no change.`

A park is honored in two places: the daemon re-checks it immediately before every build start
(closing the selection-to-dispatch race), and the HALT re-kick sweep checks it **first**, ahead
of everything else, so a parked feature survives every base-branch advance.

For an in-flight feature, parking drains exactly the active scheduling unit. A serial step reaches
its natural terminal status; a parallel group lets every started member settle and completes its
join. After those statuses are durable, the daemon logs the last settled boundary and starts no
later step or group. Parking does not cancel work inside the active unit and does not manufacture a
HALT. If you must interrupt the active unit itself, continue to step 2.

### 2. Pause or stop the daemon

Pause when you want the loop to stand down but keep the tmux session:

```bash
ai-conductor daemon pause
```

**What it changes:** writes `.daemon/PAUSED` (a JSON body carrying `pausedAt` — the body is
informational; existence is what counts). The check is fail-closed: any read error other than
"file not found" is treated as paused. Prints `daemon paused`, or `already paused`.

Stop when you are about to rewrite git state:

```bash
ai-conductor daemon stop
```

**What it changes:** kills the tmux session hosting the daemon. **Blast radius:** any in-flight
build in that session is terminated where it stands; its worktree and branch are left on disk,
and its `.pipeline/` state stops at whatever step it reached.

For a graceful drain instead of a kill, send SIGTERM to the daemon process. It drains in-flight
work for up to 30 seconds before releasing its lock. `ai-conductor daemon status` prints the pid;
it is also the `pid` field of the JSON in `.daemon/daemon.pid`.

```bash
kill -TERM <pid>
```

**How to confirm:** `ai-conductor daemon status` reports `⏸ paused` or `· stopped` for this repo.

### 3. Stopping an interactive run instead

An interactive `ai-conductor inline …` run is stopped with Ctrl-C. The signal handler writes
`.pipeline/conduct-state.json` before exiting with code 130, so the run is resumable. Do not
`kill -9` it — that skips the state write and leaves the last step's status unrecorded.

### 4. Only now touch git state

With the slug parked and the daemon paused or stopped, the worktree and branch are yours.

**Blast radius before you delete anything:**

- Removing `.worktrees/<slug>` destroys that worktree's `.pipeline/` directory — the run state,
  the task status file, the evidence sidecar, and the gate verdicts. That loss is recoverable
  but not free; see [worktree and evidence recovery](worktree-and-evidence-recovery.md).
- Deleting `feat/daemon-<slug>` destroys the commits. The branch is the source of truth. There
  is no other copy of the build's work.

Remove a worktree the way git expects, so the registration goes with it:

```bash
git worktree remove --force .worktrees/<slug>
```

If you already deleted the directory with `rm -rf`, the registration survives and every
subsequent `git worktree add` for that path fails with exit 128
(`fatal: '.worktrees/<slug>' is a missing but already registered worktree`). Clear it:

```bash
git worktree prune
```

Scope every delete to an explicit, named path. Never glob or loop over `.worktrees/*` — see the
hard rule in [daemon recovery](daemon-recovery.md).

### 5. Never unpark, then delete

Unparking makes the slug eligible again on the very next poll. If you delete its worktree or
branch after unparking, the daemon re-dispatches into the wreckage:

- A directory removed without `git worktree prune` still counts as registered, so the engine's
  reconcile step reports the worktree "reused" and hands the build a path that does not exist.
- A fresh `git worktree add` against that stale registration exits 128 on every attempt.
- Because the failure happens *before* a worktree exists, no `.pipeline/HALT` marker is written.
  Nothing durable records the failure — the feature is excluded only for the lifetime of the
  current daemon run and comes straight back on the next start or re-kick sweep.

Finish the git work first. Unpark last:

```bash
ai-conductor daemon unpark <slug>
```

**What it changes:** resets the no-evidence attempt counter (in `.worktrees/<slug>` when it
exists, otherwise at the repo root), then removes `.daemon/parked/<slug>`. The order matters —
a failed counter reset leaves the marker in place so you can retry.

## Verification

Work through all four:

1. **The park marker exists** (or is gone, if you unparked):
   ```bash
   ls .daemon/parked/
   ```
2. **The daemon is in the state you intended:**
   ```bash
   ai-conductor daemon status
   ```
   Expect `⏸ paused` or `· stopped`, and no `● running` badge for this repo.
3. **The worktree registry is consistent** — no entry is marked `prunable`:
   ```bash
   git worktree list --porcelain
   ```
4. **The feature is not dispatched on the next poll.** Resume the daemon and read the startup
   dashboard: the slug must appear under PARKED and nowhere else.
   ```bash
   ai-conductor daemon resume
   ai-conductor daemon logs --lines 40
   ```

If the feature is dispatched anyway, the park marker is not where the daemon is looking — it is
resolved against the main repo root, not the worktree you ran the command from. Re-run
`ai-conductor daemon park <slug>` from the main checkout and confirm the printed marker path.
