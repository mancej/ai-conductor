# Quickstart

Install the harness, register a project, and run one feature through the SDLC pipeline. For
operators setting up `ai-conductor` for the first time.

## Prerequisites

`bin/install` checks **none** of these before it starts. It fails late, partially, or silently if
one is missing, so install them first.

| Requirement | Needed for | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `curl` — or use the manual clone path below | downloading the one-line installer | `curl --version` |
| `git` | cloning the harness; every worktree operation | `git --version` |
| `gh`, authenticated | opening spec and implementation PRs | `gh auth status` |
| `tmux` | `ai-conductor daemon start/stop/restart/connect/debug` | `tmux -V` |
| `python3` | writing permissions and hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` | `python3 --version` |
| Node >= 26.0.0 (repo pins 26.7.0) | building and running the engine, and reading/writing the markdown-viewer and mermaid-renderer config | `node --version` |
| `npm` | `npm ci` + `npm run build` for the engine | `npm --version` |
| `claude` and/or `codex` | executing steps — at least one is required | `claude --version` / `codex --version` |
| `rg` (ripgrep) — **optional** | full shell test coverage; several tests skip themselves without it. `bin/install --check` warns, never fails | `rg --version` |

Node is pinned to `26.7.0` in `.tool-versions` and `src/conductor/.tool-versions`. Install it
with `asdf install nodejs 26.7.0` or any equivalent version manager. `bin/ai-conductor` exports
`ASDF_NODEJS_VERSION` from that pin **only when `asdf` is on `PATH`** — without asdf, whatever
`node` resolves first runs the engine.

Pick your host now: `claude`, `codex`, or both. See
[multiprovider](guides/multiprovider.md) for what each one changes.

## One-line install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://jstoup111.github.io/ai-conductor/install.sh | sh
```

This clones the `stable` channel into `~/.ai-conductor/harness` and runs `./bin/install` there, so you can skip the next two sections. Choose a channel or providers with `... | sh -s -- --channel tagged --providers claude`. Running it again updates the existing install.

## Clone the harness

To install from a manual clone instead:

```bash
git clone --branch stable --single-branch https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor.git
cd ai-conductor
```

Clone to a normal directory. A checkout whose physical path contains `/.worktrees/` is refused by
the installer — see [Refusing to install from a build worktree](#refusing-to-install-from-a-build-worktree).
The `stable` branch advances only after release CI has published its matching tag and GitHub Release;
it therefore excludes work still in flight on `main`.

## Install

```bash
./bin/install
```

On a TTY with no `--providers` flag, the installer prompts for four things: the built-in host
(Claude / Codex / both), the update channel, a markdown viewer, and a mermaid renderer. Pass the
selection up front to skip the first prompt:

```bash
./bin/install --providers=claude,codex
```

`--providers` gates only the install-time readiness report. Both skill catalogs
(`~/.claude/skills` and `~/.agents/skills`) are written regardless of the value, and the flag never
writes a host into any config.

You should see `Installation complete.` followed by a quick-start banner.

## Put `~/.local/bin` on PATH

The installer symlinks `ai-conductor` into `~/.local/bin` but **never edits your shell profile**. If
that directory is not already on `PATH` it prints:

```text
  ⚠ ~/.local/bin is NOT on PATH
  → Add to your shell profile: export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Add it yourself, then reload your shell:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Verify the install

```bash
./bin/install --check
ai-conductor --help
```

`--check` mutates nothing. Its exit code is the signal:

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | All checks passed. Prints `All checks passed.` |
| `1` | Drift: missing, stale, or duplicated skill links, or a failed host-CLI or bin-symlink check. Prints a per-category count and `Run ./bin/install to fix.` |
| `2` | Everything else is clean but `ai-conductor build-auth-status` failed |

Exit `2` prints `Build authentication check failed.` instead of the `All checks passed.` summary —
read the `build-auth-status:` line in the body for the underlying reason. The engine treats both
`0` and `2` as passing; any other code blocks `ai-conductor daemon start` on a stale install.

## Register a project

The target must already be a git repository.

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
ai-conductor register
```

You should see `Registered <name> (<absolute-path>).` The record lands in
`~/.ai-conductor/registry.json` with `status: registered`; nothing is written into the project.

To scaffold a new repository instead, `ai-conductor create <name>` runs `git init` and writes a
skeleton `CLAUDE.md`, a `.gitignore`, and a project-safe `.ai-conductor/config.yml` before
registering it. Both commands are detailed in
[reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md).

## Bootstrap the project

`register` writes no project artifacts. `create` writes the minimal scaffold described above.
`bootstrap` detects the stack and generates the remaining project instruction files, `.docs/`
tree, and memory store. It is a skill, not a CLI command, so run it inside a host session:

```bash
claude
```

Then, in-session:

```text
/bootstrap
```

Under Codex the same skill is invoked as `$bootstrap`. You should end with `CLAUDE.md` (and/or
`AGENTS.md`) referencing the harness, plus a populated `.docs/` directory.

For an existing Git repository, `bootstrap` runs the idempotent `ai-conductor config init` primitive.
You can also run that command directly before bootstrap. It creates
`.ai-conductor/config.yml` from the project-safe template and preserves an existing file
byte-for-byte. See [reference/configuration.md](reference/configuration.md).

## Run your first feature with the daemon

```bash
ai-conductor compose --idea "add a CSV export to the reporting page"
```

The composer authors the DECIDE artifacts in an isolated worktree and opens a spec PR. Review and
merge that PR, then start the daemon:

```bash
ai-conductor daemon start
```

The daemon drains merged specs, builds each feature in an isolated worktree, retains its logs, and
opens an implementation PR. Watch it with `ai-conductor daemon logs --follow` or check it with
`ai-conductor daemon status`.

Continue with [first feature](guides/first-feature.md) for the complete idea → spec PR → daemon
build → implementation PR walkthrough.

For a supervised foreground run, use
`ai-conductor inline --interactive "add a CSV export to the reporting page"`. The foreground
`--auto` mode is deprecated; use the daemon for unattended work. Inline flags are enumerated in
[reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md).

## First-run blockers

Each of these is a real guard in the code, with the text it emits.

### Missing engine bundle

The engine is gitignored, so a fresh clone has no `dist` until `bin/install` (or `npm run build`)
runs.

```text
ai-conductor: missing <harness>/src/conductor/dist/index.js
ai-conductor: run 'npm run build' in src/conductor/
```

A half-finished publish leaves a dangling symlink instead:

```text
ai-conductor: dist symlink is broken (<harness>/src/conductor/dist)
ai-conductor: run 'npm run build' to rebuild, or republish the engine, to fix it
```

Both exit `1`. Fix by re-running `./bin/install`, or `npm run build` inside `src/conductor/`. Never
run `tsup` directly — the publish guard refuses it.

### Wrong Node version

The installer still links the skills, permissions and hooks — those work on any Node — but it
cannot build the engine, so the run fails:

```text
  ✗ ai-conductor requires Node >=26 — found v20.11.0
  → This repo pins nodejs 26.7.0 via .tool-versions; install it (e.g. 'asdf install nodejs
    26.7.0'), then re-run bin/install
```

and the run ends with the reason restated:

```text
Installation incomplete — ai-conductor was not installed.
  ✗ ai-conductor requires Node >=26 but found v20.11.0. Install the pinned nodejs 26.7.0
    (.tool-versions), then re-run ./bin/install.
```

`./bin/install` exits `1`, and so does `./bin/install --check` while the bundle is missing or
`ai-conductor` is off PATH. A missing `npm`, or a failing `npm ci`/`npm run build`, fails the same
way. Install Node 26.7.0 and re-run `./bin/install`.

### Missing `gh` authentication

Nothing checks `gh` at install time. It surfaces when a spec is landed:

```text
Cannot land spec: identity unresolved. Resolve one of:
  1. Set spec_owner in ~/.ai-conductor/config.yml
  2. Authenticate via: gh auth login
```

Exit `1`. Run `gh auth login`, or set `spec_owner` in the user config. The daemon's backlog scan
fails closed on the same identity — an unidentified daemon builds nothing and logs
`daemon identity unresolved: … building NOTHING (fail-closed)`. See
[running the daemon](guides/running-the-daemon.md).

### Refusing to install from a build worktree

`bin/install` matches its own resolved physical path against `*/.worktrees/*`:

```text
  ✗ Refusing to install from a build worktree.

  Resolved harness root: <physical_root>

  Installing from a worktree would repoint your global bins, skills, and
  settings.json hooks at a directory that is deleted when the build ships.

  Fix: run bin/install from the main checkout, or pass --allow-worktree-root
  if you really mean to install from this worktree.
```

Exit `1`. The guard applies to the default and `--update` modes only; `--check`, `--uninstall`, and
`--help` are unaffected. Install from the main checkout.

### Missing or broken `ai-conductor` at viewer/renderer configuration time

The markdown-viewer and mermaid-renderer prompts write their selection through
`ai-conductor config write`, not Python/YAML. If `ai-conductor` is not yet on `PATH` (for example the
engine build failed — see [Missing engine bundle](#missing-engine-bundle) above), the prompts are
skipped:

```text
  ⚠ ai-conductor is required to save the markdown viewer; install or restore it, then re-run bin/install
```

and if the write itself fails (e.g. the target directory is unwritable), the installer warns and
the step fails rather than silently reporting success:

```text
  ⚠ Could not save markdown viewer configuration
```

Either way, `~/.ai-conductor/config.yml` gets no viewer or renderer block, and install continues
with a warning rather than aborting. Fix the underlying `ai-conductor` problem and re-run
`./bin/install`. `./bin/install --check` reports the configured viewer and renderer, or
`ai-conductor not on PATH` / `configuration unreadable` when it cannot read them back.

### Missing tmux

The daemon builds without tmux but cannot be hosted by it:

```text
tmux is not installed or not found on PATH. Please install tmux to use daemon hosting.
```

Install tmux before `ai-conductor daemon start`. Recovery for a daemon that started and then broke is
in [runbooks/daemon-recovery.md](runbooks/daemon-recovery.md).

## Updates

The installer writes `conductor.update_channel` — `stable` (default), `tagged`, or `main` — to
`~/.ai-conductor/config.yml`; it does not create the legacy JSON configuration file. `stable`
fast-forwards a branch only to fully published releases, `tagged` uses semver tag checkouts, and
`main` follows every merge. Existing tag-pinned installations are not switched automatically.

`ai-conductor` spawns `bin/update --auto` on startup and swallows every failure. Force an attended
check, or update a stable checkout manually:

```bash
cd /path/to/ai-conductor
bin/update
# or:
git pull --ff-only origin stable && bin/migrate
```

A **major** version crossing — `v0.104.0 → v1.0.0`, or any change to the leading semver
component — is held to a stricter approval than an ordinary update, because a major is by
definition a breaking change to skill contracts, the CLI, or the `settings.json` schema:

- The startup `--auto` check reports that one is available and stops there. It never applies a
  major update, so a breaking upgrade cannot be accepted by reflex at the start of a session.
- An attended `bin/update` requires typing the target version (`v1.0.0`) to confirm. A bare `y`
  does not apply it.
- With no TTY, the command to run is printed and nothing is applied, as with any other update.

Ordinary patch and minor updates keep the single `[y/n]` prompt. The `main` channel has no semver
identity to compare, so it is unaffected.

If a stable checkout ends up in detached HEAD — a pre-v1 updater moved stable installs with
`git checkout vX.Y.Z` — `bin/update` offers to re-attach the `stable` branch instead of stopping.
Answer the prompt, or run the `git checkout -B stable <sha> && bin/migrate` command it prints when
there is no TTY. A detached checkout you made yourself, off the `stable` lineage, is left alone.

Choose the first-run channel during installation with `bin/install --channel tagged` (or `main` or
`stable`), or set `AI_CONDUCTOR_CHANNEL` when passing a flag is inconvenient. The flag takes
precedence over the environment variable; an unattended install with neither uses `stable`.

Choose a different channel explicitly with `bin/update --set-channel tagged` or
`bin/update --set-channel main`. Changing the configured channel does not move the current checkout.
To move an existing branch-based installation to `stable` deliberately:

```bash
git fetch origin stable:refs/remotes/origin/stable
git switch --track origin/stable
bin/update --set-channel stable
bin/migrate
```

## Removing the harness

```bash
./bin/install --uninstall
```

> **Known limitation.** `--uninstall` removes the harness-owned skill symlinks, the
> `HARNESS.md` links, and all three installer-owned launchers: `conduct`, `ai-conductor`, and
> `ai-conductor`. It still leaves 18
> permission entries and 10 hook commands written into `~/.claude/settings.json`, all of
> `~/.ai-conductor/`, and any legacy `~/.claude/ai-conductor.config.json` or
> `~/.claude/ai-conductor.config.json.migrated` artifact. If you then delete the checkout,
> those hooks point at a directory that no longer exists and every Claude Code session in every
> project runs them. Strip the harness entries from `~/.claude/settings.json` by hand — see
> [reference/settings-and-hooks.md](reference/settings-and-hooks.md).
