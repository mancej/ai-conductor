# Gates

What a gate is in this harness, the four enforcement levels, the gates that can block a feature, and the
waiver mechanism. Per-step enforcement values are listed in [steps](../reference/steps.md); the integrity
check suite is a different thing and lives in [validation](../contributing/validation.md).

## What a gate is

A gate is a check that can block progression. Every step passes through two of them before the flow moves on:

1. **The prerequisite gate.** Every step names the steps it depends on. The gate passes when all of them are
   satisfied — where satisfied means `done`, `skipped`, or `stale`. A skipped step therefore never wedges
   its dependents.
2. **The completion gate.** After a step runs, the engine recomputes whether it is actually done by reading
   evidence off disk, and writes the verdict to `.pipeline/gates/<step>.json`. The loop owns that verdict.
   An agent cannot declare its own step complete; see [evidence model](evidence-model.md).

A step that never ran still leaves a verdict. When the engine resolves a verdict-bearing step by *skipping*
it — complexity tier, work track, bootstrap mode, an upstream skip, `disable: true`, a false `when:`, or an
advisory step that failed and was auto-skipped in auto mode — it writes
`{"satisfied": true, "reason": "skipped: <cause>"}` to `.pipeline/gates/<step>.json`. Satisfaction is
unchanged (the selector has always treated a skipped gate as satisfied); what changes is that the skip is
*recorded*. Before this, a skipped gate left no verdict file at all and the selector fell back to the step's
own status flag. Read the `skipped: ` prefix as "this gate was deliberately not run", never as "this gate's
evidence passed".

Those two are orthogonal. Prerequisites answer *may this run yet*; completion answers *did it actually
happen*. A step can pass the first and fail the second forever, which is exactly what a halt looks like.

## The four enforcement levels

Enforcement is a property of the step, not of the gate. It decides what happens when the step fails.

| Level | On failure in auto mode | In interactive mode | Can config disable it? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `advisory` | marked `skipped`, run continues | recovery menu, `skip` offered | yes |
| `gating` | run halts | recovery menu, tagged `[gating]`, `skip` withheld | no, unless the step definition opts in |
| `structural` | run halts | recovery menu, `skip` offered | never — the opt-in flag is ignored |
| `mechanical` | — | — | not accepted by the config validator |

Read the levels as a statement about *who can decline the step*:

- **Advisory** steps are useful, not load-bearing. Memory recall, exploration, and architecture diagrams.
  If one fails unattended the run keeps going rather than stranding an otherwise valid feature.
- **Gating** steps are the correctness contract. A failure means the thing being gated is not true yet, so
  the run stops rather than proceeding on a false premise. The interactive recovery menu drops the `skip`
  option for these — you can retry, fix interactively, go back, or quit, but you cannot wave one through.
- **Structural** steps are mechanics the flow cannot proceed without: the worktree, the build itself, the
  rebase. They fail the run in auto mode like a gating step, and no project config can turn one off.
- **Mechanical** is declared in the type union and documented as the hook-based enforcement tier, but no
  step definition uses it and the config validator rejects it. It is currently a reserved word.

Exactly one built-in gating step opts into being disabled by project config, and that opt-in is per step and
must be committed in `.ai-conductor/config.yml`. The point of the restriction is that a partial or
copy-pasted config can never silently drop a guardrail.

## The gate catalog

Gates come in five families. The families exist in different places in the codebase because they run at
different times against different evidence.

| Family | Runs | Blocks | Count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prerequisite | before every step | that step | 1 (universal) |
| per-step completion | after a step runs, and whenever the loop re-scores it | that step, and the loop | 12 |
| land-time | when a spec PR is landed | the spec, before anything is built | 10 |
| self-host | before the finish step, only when the harness is building itself | the PR | 6 |
| hook | at the moment of a tool call | the individual edit, command, or dispatch | see [settings and hooks](../reference/settings-and-hooks.md) |

### Commit scope-containment boundary

The generated `commit-msg` hook checks staged paths on a task-attributed commit against the active task's
declared files. A path outside that declaration is diagnosed with one copy-pasteable
`Scope: <path> — <rationale>` trailer per path. Those trailers make an intentional widening visible to the
engine-side containment floor and to `build_review`; they do not declare a task complete or waive semantic
scope review.

Containment ships report-only by default because false-positive refusals can stall a live build. The checker
prints every verified violation but returns `0`, so the commit proceeds and the containment floor retains the
evidence for later review. Set `build_review.scopeContainmentEnforced: true` to enable refusal. Its
three-valued contract keeps the hook safe if state is unavailable: `0` allows (including a reported default
violation), `2` is a positive refusal when enforcement is enabled, and every other result is an abstention
that the hook logs and allows. The hook converts only `2` to Git's blocking exit `1`; malformed or missing
task state never blocks a build.

At `build_review`, the containment floor writes `.pipeline/containment-floor.json`. Every violation is also
printed in the step output and warning log with its task id, commit SHA, and offending paths. Every accepted
widening is supplied directly to the isolated grader with its path, rationale, task id, and commit SHA, because
the grader judges the branch diff rather than commit messages. The rubric projection carries that diff by
reference — per-file paths, change kinds, and hunk line ranges anchored to the merge base — and the grader
session, running inside the feature worktree, reads the referenced file contents and per-path diffs itself
instead of receiving the raw diff text inline.

The advisory remains in the warning log and step output on every lap. On a failing lap it follows the review's
own reason, so the failure and retry lines name the actual review failure; on a passing lap it precedes the
review output.

### Declared pattern replication check

A plan may declare, in its header, that it replicates an existing source file under a rename map
(`**Pattern-source:**` / `**Rename-map:**`, parsed by `plan-pattern-source.ts`). When the declaration
resolves, `build_review` runs a deterministic content-comparison check — the engine's first — before the
grader runs: it reads the declared copy target, applies the rename map to the source, and requires an
exact match. Unlike the per-task floors above, which are fail-soft and never change `success`, a copy
mismatch **fails the step** outright, and its diagnostic (missing target, unexpected target, a rename-map
collision, or a content mismatch naming the first differing line and column) is returned in place of a
grader verdict — no RED evidence is derived from it, and it never runs at `acceptance_specs`. A
`malformed` declaration (one header line without the other, an unresolvable source path, or an invalid
rename-map pair) fails `build_review` before either the equivalence check or the grader runs, so a
half-declaration can never be read as no declaration at all.

### Per-step completion gates

These are the twelve gates that decide whether a step's work is real. Ten replace the default
"did the step's artifact glob match anything" check with a custom predicate; two more run only in the
verdict layer, so they can be strict without disturbing the linear walk.

| Step | What it protects against |
| --- | --- |
| `stories` | stories that exist but do not specify behavior — every story needs a happy path and a negative path, each with scenarios, and none may be draft |
| `plan` | a plan that does not cover the feature's stories, scoped to this feature's plan and stories |
| `build` | tasks reported complete without work — task rows are re-seeded and re-derived from the plan each evaluation, so a forged row fails; a task carrying `Done when:` checks additionally must show each check true before it closes, and a check the approved plan cannot make true is reported as a plan gap rather than repaired off-plan |
| `acceptance_specs` | acceptance specs that never ran — proof is required that this feature's specs executed *and failed*, so a collection error or a skipped spec cannot pass for RED |
| `build_review` | an incomplete build — a container of individually opt-in rubrics (currently only `testQuality`, off by default) judged from the diff rather than self-reports; an empty rubric set is a PASS with nothing dispatched |
| `test_suite` | a stale green — the fingerprint is re-inspected every time, so the evidence file's existence can never satisfy it |
| `manual_test` | a whitewashed retest — after a recorded FAIL, HEAD must have moved before an all-PASS attempt is accepted |
| `prd_audit` | a partial or malformed audit report passing as complete — exactly one graded verdict row (`PASS`, `FIXABLE`, `PLAN_GAP`, or `OVER_SCOPE`) is required for every acceptance criterion across the feature's stories; a `FIXABLE` naming no plan task blocks. A cited `Plan task` is resolved against the ids the active plan actually declares — an id the plan does not carry is rejected by name, and a report whose active plan cannot be resolved at all is rejected fail-closed rather than having its citations taken on trust. A finding without an owning criterion is a unique `NC.<n>` `OVER_SCOPE` row in `## Findings without an owning criterion`; its visible-scope operator decision is valid only for the same evidence summary. Invalid or duplicate rows are rejected individually while valid siblings remain routable, but any rejected row blocks with its diagnostic. Only the `## Verdict Table` section's story rows count as verdicts, so a prior-cycle history table cannot block an all-`PASS` audit. An unresolvable or unreadable criterion set also blocks fail-closed |
| `architecture_review_as_built` | an unrecognized verdict passing by default — only an explicit approval verdict satisfies it |
| `finish` | a publication outcome that was never coherently recorded — `.pipeline/finish-choice` is the final record, not the source of interactive intent; a `pr` outcome additionally requires the recorded PR identity and verified publication evidence |
| `finish` (release readiness) | a configured release-disposition result that is missing, stale, malformed, or unreadable — FINISH reports the exact typed condition before dispatching prose authoring or judgment, or making a publication mutation |
| `finish` (prose authorship) | a retained PR whose body is still the engine-seeded placeholder, or whose exact authored revision received a persisted `revision_required` judgment — the coordinator dispatches its `author_pr_prose` pass with the branch diff and feature artifacts; a judged-deficient revision also carries the concrete objection into that pass. It accepts the pass only when fresh observation selects the next valid publication transition. The judgment pass is therefore never handed unauthored prose, and a prose defect neither commits the shipped record nor deadlocks the author→judge revision lap |
| `finish` (presentation) | a PR shipping with halt boilerplate or an engine-generated floor body (the body-floor marker plus floor content — a marker an authoring pass left behind on real prose does not count) — either classification keeps a bounded prose pass required and prevents the final outcome record. Every completion-gate refusal in this class is classified `missing: 'presentation'`, which routes the loop back into `finish` for a body rewrite rather than into `/remediate` or `build`; that re-dispatch is bounded to one attempt per `pr_url` (recorded in `.pipeline/pr-body-regen-attempt.json`), after which the engine's deterministic body floor runs as a last resort so the feature still converges. A reused halt PR's *presentation* is repaired earlier still — whenever the retained SHIP PR identity is resolved (SHIP-phase adoption, the pre-finish snapshot, or the finish-time restore), so SHIP steps that run before `finish` do not read a `needs-remediation` placeholder; a lighter clear additionally runs once at the start of every dispatch regardless of phase, so a resumed `BUILD` step is not left holding the placeholder either; the draft→ready flip stays finish-only |

Within `build_review`, `testQuality`'s revert-and-rerun preflight runs only when the rubric is opted in
(`build_review.rubrics.testQuality.enabled: true`); with the rubric off, no preflight runs. The
counterfactual is classified solely by the scoped command's exit code; the engine does not parse
runner-specific output. Exit code zero stays green and every nonzero exit is counterfactual RED. Only
launch, timeout, and signal are scoped-run infrastructure outcomes. The preflight is evidence the judge
may cite, never a finding by itself — a test that stays green under revert is not automatically a
failure. A preflight infrastructure failure carries its bounded diagnostic excerpt on the existing
`.pipeline/events.jsonl` event spine and in the `build_review` aggregate, so a materialization or
scoped-run failure remains diagnosable after the mechanical allowance is exhausted.

Each predicate's exact file, format, and failure text is in [artifacts](../reference/artifacts.md).

### Tree-attesting admission

A step may declare itself tree-attesting only when its completion predicate re-verifies the current
tree rather than trusting persisted step state. At the dispatch boundary, a persisted `done` status for
such a step is fast-forwarded only when that predicate still passes; a stale or indeterminate result
falls through to normal dispatch. The check reads evidence and does not reconcile or rewrite state.
`skipped` remains a scheduling decision and is never re-evaluated by this rule.

The same rule applies at resume entry (`--resume`, including a daemon restart): a `done` step with a
satisfied on-disk gate verdict is re-checked against its tree-attesting predicate before resume clamps
its starting index to a later step. A predicate that no longer passes, or that throws, pulls the resume
entry back to that step instead of trusting the stale verdict — this is what lets a daemon restart
after a rebase land on `test_suite` rather than resuming past it into `build_review`.

The current tree-attesting set is `{build, test_suite}`. `build` re-derives task completion from the
current history, and `test_suite` re-inspects its content fingerprint. This admission rule prevents a
rebase-invalidated suite proof from allowing `build_review` to run ahead of `test_suite` while preserving
the ordinary fast path for a current proof.

### BUILD-verification round authority

`test_suite` is the sole BUILD verifier. After BUILD is repaired, it re-inspects the current suite
evidence; a satisfied gate verdict on disk never skips that verification by itself. Its current
result is the sole authority that marks the verifier satisfied for that round.

### Land-time gates

These run when the composer loop lands a spec branch, outside the step loop. They protect the base branch
from specs that would waste a build.

| Gate | Refuses |
| --- | --- |
| required artifacts | a spec missing its PRD, stories, or plan, or with an empty one |
| draft/stub reject | any artifact still marked draft, or a known stub string |
| stories approval | stories without the explicit acceptance marker — not being draft is not enough |
| ADR status | any ADR under `.docs/decisions/` whose first line-anchored `Status:` declaration is not `APPROVED` or `SUPERSEDED`, or that declares no status at all — fenced code-block examples of rejected statuses are excluded from matching |
| tier agreement | a declared complexity tier that disagrees with the artifacts present |
| coherence | a traceability record that does not connect outcomes, requirements, accepted ADRs, stories, and tasks, or stories that do not tie out to the PRD |
| mermaid render | a diagram that does not render — previously prose guidance, now enforced |
| diagram presence | a non-Small architecture artifact with no fenced Mermaid block |
| protected-target plan | a task that directs BUILD to amend another feature's sealed DECIDE artifact |
| plan completion checks | a task with no `Done when:` block, a blank check, fewer than two checks, or more than five checks; fenced-code examples are ignored |
| plan task count | a plan with 41 or more parsed tasks unless it has exactly one `**Scope-exception:**` declaration with a non-empty rationale; 21–40 tasks are a plan-authoring warning, not a land refusal |
| architecture obligation coverage | a decision in a changed land-accepted ADR (`APPROVED` or `SUPERSEDED`) with no unique disposition, an invented decision, an invalid disposition, a nonexistent task, or task evidence absent from the cited task's `Done when:` block |

Before land, plan authoring runs `ai-conductor plan-protected-targets <plan-path>`. It is a blocking,
read-only check that reports every offending task/path pair. Land repeats the same judgment against
the plan being landed, so a plan cannot bypass the rule by skipping the authoring command. Both gates
apply at every tier and judge only the current plan, not historical plans already merged.

The coherence gate is itself layered. Tier S always engages its criterion layer, carried directly in the
plan. At other tiers, a change set with no coherence artifact path is treated as a legacy change rather
than a violation. Once engaged, the story, criterion, orphan-task, and coverage-table layers are always
required; the functional-requirement layer only on the product track; the outcome layer only when outcomes
exist; and the ADR layer whenever the current spec change set contains a `.docs/decisions/adr-*` path,
including a deletion. The ADR row pool itself contains only non-deleted ADRs, so a deletion-only change
engages the layer but passes with no ADR row. It aggregates every waivable gap rather than stopping at the
first, and reports them as one error. Already-landed specs whose coherence artifacts predate criterion
rows remain valid for daemon discovery and BUILD. See [composer loop](../guides/engineer-loop.md).

When that ADR pool contains citable decisions, the plan must also carry an `## Architecture Obligation
Coverage` table with exactly one row per `<adr-stem>#D<n>`. A row dispositions the decision to real plan
tasks, existing implementation, or no implementation change. The engine validates complete and unique
decision coverage, the closed disposition vocabulary, real task ids, and an exact evidence fragment from
a cited task's `Done when:` block. Missing or malformed bookkeeping is non-waivable. The subsequent
`coherence-check` judgement decides whether the mapped task or existing/no-change evidence actually
satisfies the decision; the engine does not derive that semantic answer from matching text.

The criterion layer requires exactly one row for every happy- and negative-path criterion extracted from
the stories artifact. Each row must mark the criterion `covered`, cite an existing plan task, quote an
exact span from at least one cited task after whitespace normalization, and carry the authored
diff-locality disposition `diff-local`. `outside-diff` records that the criterion depends on state beyond
the feature diff and blocks land unless a fresh coherence waiver covers the reported gap. The engine reads
that disposition; it does not infer locality from the criterion's prose. Omitted, invented, duplicate,
non-covered, ungrounded, and missing-disposition rows are also coverage gaps. A malformed criterion row or
a stories artifact with no parseable criteria is defective evidence and fails before waiver evaluation.
See [artifacts](../reference/artifacts.md#coherence-mapping-shape) for the row format.

Each task's leading `**Story:**` line cites its story with `story-N`, `Story N`, bare `N`, or `epic-N`;
the cited id may include dots or hyphens. A task that cites no declared story is reported as an orphan. The
failure names the unbindable id and these accepted spellings; a missing or empty reference line is reported
as absent rather than assigned an invented id.

The functional-requirement layer checks both directions, because coverage alone is only half of a tie-out.
Forward, a PRD requirement no story cites — or whose only citing stories no task covers — is a gap.
Reverse, a story that cites an `FR-N` the PRD never declares, or that cites no requirement at all, is a gap
against that story's id. The reverse direction runs on the product track only: a technical-track spec has no
PRD, so it has no requirement layer to tie out against. What the gate does not judge is whether a story
*semantically* delivers the requirement it cites — a story whose scenarios contradict its own FR is a
`fail` verdict the `/coherence-check` skill records, not a set comparison. Story-versus-story contradictions
belong to `conflict-check` earlier in DECIDE; this gate compares each story against the PRD only.

Earlier in DECIDE, `conflict_check` also compares each relevant story with the selected approved ADR
corpus. The default `change_set` corpus is bounded to the current spec's ADRs; `repo_wide` narrows all
approved ADRs to overlapping subjects and records the ADRs it examined and excluded. That judgment resolves
ADR-versus-story conflicts before planning. This is separate from the coherence gate: any current-change-set
ADR path engages its ADR layer, while only non-deleted ADR files enter the traceability-row pool; no
conceptual applicability judgment expands that row set.

### Self-host gates

When the harness builds itself, an extra bundle activates as one unit behind a single decision. It covers
version approval, the release artifact gate, a live-boundary fingerprint, a build-auth preflight, a sandbox
build environment, and a skill relink preflight. These protect the running checkout from the build that is
modifying it. Details and the release-gate specifics are in [releases](../contributing/releases.md) and
[self-hosting](../guides/self-hosting.md).

## Fail-closed semantics

Every completion gate fails closed. Missing evidence, stale evidence, malformed evidence, and a non-passing
verdict all leave the gate unsatisfied — none of them is treated as "probably fine".

Three specific forms this takes:

- **Presence is never proof.** Several gates re-derive their answer even when a passing artifact is sitting
  right there, because the artifact could describe a previous state of the code.
- **Freshness is part of the check.** A verdict must be newer than a floor — the current judging attempt
  when there is one, otherwise the run's session start. The SHIP-tail verdict gates additionally require an
  engine-stamped dispatch `runId` when one is available; a mismatch is no verdict and retries rather than
  routing the earlier report's findings. Unstamped legacy artifacts retain the mtime fallback. A small
  filesystem-clock tolerance applies to the attempt floor only.
- **Undeterminable is a failure, not a pass.** When a gate cannot compute its input at all — an unresolvable
  plan among several, a change set git cannot produce, a scope it cannot bound — it blocks. It does not
  guess.

The one deliberate fail-open: when a run carries no session-start timestamp at all, freshness checks pass on
file presence, so upgrading the harness mid-feature does not strand an in-flight build.

## Kickback and remediation routing

A blocking gate in the tail loop does not simply stop. It routes.

**Kickback** re-opens an upstream gate by writing an unsatisfied verdict that carries provenance: which step
re-opened it, and the evidence. Four steps opt in as kickback targets — `prd`, `architecture_review`,
`stories`, `plan` — so the furthest back the loop can throw work is the spec. Kickbacks per gate are capped;
past the cap the run halts instead of cycling.

An autonomous run may enter a DECIDE step only with explicit operator direction. The same fail-closed
policy is consulted at all four navigation seams: the forward walk, the verdict-aware resume clamp,
the verdict-driven `scanKickbackVerdicts` rewind, and the planner-driven `planRemediation` rewind. An
unknown target or phase, or an unsatisfied or unverified DECIDE completion contract, writes a
`needs-human` HALT and launches no provider. This supersedes the two-seam DECIDE-kickback policy from
#551.

The policy fast-forwards without dispatch only when the DECIDE step is tier-skipped, has no completion
contract, or has a verified satisfied contract. Otherwise an operator must create a matching
[`decide-grant`](../reference/cli.md#ai-conductor-decide-grant); the grant authorizes one named step and
is consumed immediately before that step dispatches. The grant is stored in the daemon-owned
`.daemon/grants/<slug>.json`, outside every feature worktree, so a build agent cannot author its own
authorization; a `decide-grant.json` inside `.pipeline/` authorizes nothing. `plan` is excluded
entirely — it is refused before any grant is consulted, and the CLI rejects `--step plan`, because a
daemon that re-plans rewrites an approved DECIDE artifact with no human at the gate. A `planRemediation` rewind that names a DECIDE
step is the one exception: remediation explicitly asking to revise that step is evidence the accepted
artifact needs another look, so a satisfied contract does not fast-forward it either — the same grant
is still required. Interactive runs retain their existing DECIDE authoring path.

**Remediation** is what a blocking SHIP audit — `prd_audit`'s `FIXABLE` grades, or the as-built review's
`BLOCKED` verdict — does when the fix is not obvious. It classifies each gap and routes it to the
earliest step that can close it — build,
acceptance specs, architecture review, or plan — all of which sit before the gate that found it. A fifth
disposition, `publication`, covers a gap whose only defect is the published PR prose (a placeholder or
wrong-template body, a stale title, a missing `Closes` reference): it routes to `finish`, the step that owns
PR prose, and — unlike the four step-valued targets — appends nothing to `.docs/plans/<slug>.md`, because a
PR body fix is not plan work and amending the plan from here trips the protected-artifact self-amendment
guard. Two gap categories cannot be routed and halt for a human instead: architectural clarity and product
scope. Neither is something an unattended run should decide.

A finish-gate refusal that is *itself* a publication defect never reaches the planner at all. The gate
already names exactly what is wrong with the PR, so the loop re-dispatches `finish` directly for a body
rewrite — bounded to one re-dispatch, after which the gate's own last-resort body floor converges the
feature. Routing that through the planner is what once turned a 30-second `gh pr edit` into an 18-task
rebuild.

A verified FINISH publication transition is progress, not a failed attempt: it immediately re-enters
FINISH without spending the step retry budget or advancing its model-escalation rung. This separate
allowance is bounded to 14 verified transitions per FINISH step entry. If publication still has not
converged when the allowance is exhausted, the conductor writes a `needs-human` HALT naming the last
transition rather than looping indefinitely. The [stalled-feature runbook](../runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md#finish-publication-halts)
defines diagnosis and recovery for that halt.

If the remediation plan is missing, stale, malformed, or has gaps it does not cover, the engine falls back
to deterministic routing rather than trusting a partial plan. Unknown dispositions are dropped, not
honored.

An ordinary `build` disposition must carry concrete tasks — a taskless `build` gap is dropped and the run
halts instead of dispatching an empty route to the builder. The one exception is a build-stall question:
there the answer legitimately lives in the gap's `rationale` with `tasks: []`, so a taskless `build` is
accepted only when the gap's source is a build-stall.

For a `prd_audit` `FIXABLE` finding, the remediation disposition identifies the finding by its report
criterion: a feature without a PRD uses `S<story>.<ordinal>` (for example, `S5.1`), while a PRD-backed
finding may use its `FR-N` identity. The engine matches criterion keys case-insensitively when admitting
the planner's task, so a case-only spelling difference cannot strand an otherwise authorized repair.
An ID that matches neither an admitted criterion nor another authorized gate finding halts with the
rejected IDs and the available admission keys rather than appending unbounded work.

A sixth disposition, `existing-task`, covers a current `prd_audit` `FIXABLE` or as-built `REMEDIABLE`
finding whose remedy an existing active-plan task's **Done when** already admits. The planner binds the
gap to the real plan task id(s); the engine re-stages those rows to `pending` in
`.pipeline/task-status.json` and kicks back to `build` without appending anything to the plan. It charges
one lap under the owning gate's key (`gates.prd_audit` or `gates.architecture_review_as_built`) and never
draws from the shared plan-growth allowance, so a lap-cap halt names `lap cap reached (n/n)` rather than
the growth figures. A bound id absent from the active plan halts `needs-human` naming that id. The no-op
escalation stays armed for every gate on the lap: each participating gate banks the pre-re-stage resolved
count, so a BUILD that only re-completes the re-staged rows on a byte-identical tree is classified
`no-work` and halts instead of admitting another lap. When the same validation-group round also carries a
`manual_test` FAIL, the consolidated kickback owns the work order: the finding rides that single merged
rewind, and the existing-task lap, pending-finding, and re-stage mechanics do not run.

Remediation tasks must not order a regression. A task that removes, replaces, rewrites, or relaxes
existing code, tests, or assertions has to name the completed plan task or story criterion whose
delivered behavior and coverage survive the change, and — unless the evidence shows that coverage is
redundant — carry the replacement in the same task as the removal. Removing a workaround does not
license dropping the assertion beside it: the next audit re-raises the lost coverage and the lap is
spent restoring it. This applies to every remediation trigger, not only the `finish` verification's
test failures.

The same bar covers regression by omission. When a task changes an enumeration, registry,
vocabulary, id list, grammar, or any value a second location duplicates or must agree with, it has to
name that counterpart and bring it along in the same task, or derive both from one source so they
cannot drift again — the stronger fix wherever the evidence supports it. A pair that silently
diverges stays invisible until something reads both and fails, which is one audit lap later than the
task that split them.

Remediation tasks close the class, not the cited instance. A gap's evidence records where the
auditor looked, not how far the defect reaches, so a task is swept for every site of the same shape
before it is emitted — sibling sites carrying the same wrong predicate, missing guard, or stale
literal, and whatever a removal orphans, such as the deleted arm's last caller or its fixtures.
This is the main defence against audit cycling: a task that repairs one site of a class buys a
single cycle and generates its own successor at the next site, which is how a feature whose
blocking-gap count is genuinely falling can still spend four cycles on one requirement.

The sweep is bounded by plan admission and does not widen the diff on its own authority. A sibling
site is included only when an existing plan task admits it — the same coverage test remediation
applies before selecting `plan` — and one that no task admits is recorded in the disposition's
rationale as found-and-excluded rather than fixed. That boundary is deliberate: closing a class by
adding work the plan does not cover is exactly what `prd_audit` grades `OVER_SCOPE`, and an
unauthorized addition can leave remediation with nothing dispatchable at all, which costs more than
the audit cycle the sweep was meant to save.

A remediation gap that requires amending another feature's sealed DECIDE artifact is not eligible for
`build` or `acceptance_specs`. It returns to the owning DECIDE step; in daemon mode the existing
DECIDE kickback policy reaches the operator gate rather than attempting a BUILD-side bypass.

### A prior lap's FAIL is not a fresh verdict

`build_review` completion reads `.pipeline/build-review.json` and compares its `lapId` against
`lap-<HEAD>`. A non-`PASS` aggregate whose `lapId` names an earlier HEAD is scored `absent` — "no
fresh verdict" — rather than reused as the current lap's outcome: a rubric that FAILed a prior lap
never kicks back findings the current lap has not itself judged, and the run instead re-dispatches
`build_review` to produce a verdict for the code actually at HEAD. A `git rev-parse HEAD` failure
skips the check and preserves the older behavior rather than blocking on an unresolvable HEAD. PASS
aggregates are unaffected — they keep the existing code-stamp preservation path that lets a
same-surface PASS survive re-dispatch. The stale condition is recorded on the event spine as
`build_review_stale_aggregate` (telemetry only; never consulted for routing) and consumes no
kickback budget.

The same rule guards the daemon's post-retry kickback route. When `build_review` exhausts its
retries, the daemon re-reads the raw verdict to build the kickback evidence; a stale-lap FAIL
aggregate found there is discarded outright (the artifact is deleted, exactly like the stale-mirage
disposition) and the run re-lands on `build_review` instead of kicking its prior-lap findings back
to `build`. Without this, a stored `lapId` that never matches a moving HEAD replayed already-fixed
findings as kickbacks indefinitely. The discard also emits `build_review_stale_aggregate`. A
second stale-lap FAIL in the same run means the grader itself is stamping a prior lap, so the run
halts `needs-human` instead of re-landing again.

A below-cap mechanical (infrastructure) fault publishes no aggregate at all, so it cannot be stale
by this check; the last such fault is instead recorded on the kickback ledger's `build_review` gate
entry (`lastMechanicalFault`) and surfaces in `ai-conductor build-review findings` and in the
exhausted-mechanical-allowance HALT when the current lap has no readable diagnostic of its own — see
[the runbook](../runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md#build_review-halted-on-an-exhausted-mechanical-fault-allowance).

### Where a `build_review` FAIL goes

`build_review` no longer judges plan conformance, outcome delivery, or mechanism soundness (FR-1): the
`scope`, `completeness`, and `rootCause` rubrics are retired, and the container ships only `testQuality`,
off by default. A `testQuality` finding — a test that could pass against a stub of the behavior it claims
to cover — is a local diff defect the builder can fix in place, so a `build_review` FAIL routes straight
to `build`; there is no remediation-planner branch for a `build_review` FAIL. The questions the retired
rubrics used to ask now live at SHIP:

| Retired rubric | Question it asked | Now owned by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scope` | Does the diff contain work the plan does not describe? | `prd_audit`'s `OVER_SCOPE` grade (scope-as-intent, see below) |
| `completeness` | Does the diff cover everything the plan describes? | `prd_audit`'s `FIXABLE`/`PLAN_GAP` grades against story acceptance criteria, and the per-task `Done when:` evidence check at task close |
| `rootCause` | Does the mechanism actually close the defect? | The as-built architecture review's `PLAN_GAP`/`BLOCKED` verdict |

### `prd_audit`'s grades and routing

`prd_audit` runs on every feature, regardless of complexity tier or work track (FR-8) — no tier or track
skip remains on the step, and the skill itself does not infer one from tier, track, or the absence of a
PRD. When a feature's stories carry no acceptance criteria to judge, there is nothing to grade and the
audit trivially passes. It judges the shipped
implementation against the stories' acceptance criteria as the authority, using PRD functional
requirements as context for intent when a PRD exists (FR-7). Each finding carries exactly one grade:

| Grade | Meaning | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PASS` | The shipped behavior satisfies the criterion. | Nothing — no finding is recorded. |
| `FIXABLE` | The criterion is unmet and an existing plan task owns the repair; the finding names that task and the criterion (FR-11) or is rejected as malformed. | Appends at most one remediation lap's worth of tasks, capped at both a fixed count (default 5) and a fraction of the authored task count (default 25%), whichever is lower — both operator-configurable (FR-12). Exceeding the cap, or needing a second lap, halts for the operator listing every finding instead of appending tasks (FR-13). |
| `PLAN_GAP` | The criterion is unmet and no plan task owns the repair. | Halts for the operator when the unmet criterion is a happy-path scenario; for a negative-path or edge scenario it is recorded in the verdict and the shipped record and the feature may ship, unless operator configuration requires a halt (FR-14). |
| `OVER_SCOPE` | Shipped behavior goes beyond the planned implementation, judged against intent — the PRD's Goals/Non-Goals and In/Out Scope when a PRD exists, otherwise the stories plus the plan's stated outcome (FR-9). | A widening within intent is self-accepted and recorded. A widening outside intent with no user-visible effect is recorded in the verdict and the shipped record and the feature ships. Every outside-visible finding is presented in one decision block. An explicit accept clears that criterion; a refusal remains blocking and re-halts as “refused — rework required.” |

No SHIP-phase gate — `prd_audit`, the as-built review, or `manual_test` — can send work back to `build`
that the approved plan does not authorize; every off-plan need is a halt or a recorded, non-blocking
finding (FR-17). At this feature's ship, FR-17 is delivered for `prd_audit` and the as-built review only;
the `manual_test` route (`conductor.ts:4726-4800`) was out of scope because `manual_test` appears zero
times in this feature's plan, stories, and coherence mapping — tracked as
[#1826](https://github.com/jstoup111/ai-conductor/issues/1826), which also carries the `prd_audit`
`impl-only` fallback (`conductor.ts:8872-8917`).

### The as-built architecture review's checks and verdict

The as-built review runs on every feature (FR-15). Its checks are conditional on artifact presence and
complexity tier — the reachability sweep and the plan-gap check run at every tier; `adrCompliance` runs
whenever approved ADRs exist; `diagramDrift` runs where diagrams exist — and each is
operator-configurable per tier via `architecture_review_as_built.checks.<name>.tiers`. Its verdict is one
of `APPROVED`, `PLAN_GAP`, or `BLOCKED` (FR-16): `PLAN_GAP` means the code faithfully implements the
approved design and the design itself is the limit. The outcome it is judged against is the sealed
story criteria under `.docs/stories/` — superseded `.docs/intake/` capture is never the authority — so
the gap is recorded in the verdict and the shipped record and ships when those criteria are satisfied,
and halts only when a sealed story criterion is unmet.

A `BLOCKED` report must contain exactly one `## Blocking Findings` table with `Finding`, `Class`,
`Governing clause`, and `Summary` columns. `Class` is either `REMEDIABLE` or `DESIGN`. Every
`REMEDIABLE` row names an approved ADR decision (`<ADR filename stem> decision <number>`, where the word
`decision` is optional) or a task in the feature's active plan; a missing or malformed table, class,
clause, or row is invalid and halts for a human. Inline markdown emphasis around the clause — a
backticked or bolded stem — is stripped before the clause is resolved, so `` `adr-x` + Decision 4 ``
resolves exactly as `adr-x decision 4` does. A clause naming more than one reference
(`Task 9 and Task 10`) remains unresolvable: cite one clause per row and split the finding.

When every valid finding is `REMEDIABLE`, daemon runs with as-built remediation enabled can dispatch the
bounded remediation route, append the authorized repair work, and re-stage BUILD. The route is bounded by
`architecture_review_as_built.max_remediation_laps` and the shared plan-growth allowance; exhausting
either produces a `kickback-cap` halt before another append. A `DESIGN` finding (including a mixed
report) halts for a human decision and names each DESIGN finding with its governing clause. An all-
`REMEDIABLE` report that cannot route halts `needs-human`, names whether remediation was disabled,
the run was not a daemon, or the planner produced no usable plan, and lists every blocking finding.
An invalid report halts with its parse fault. After a later successful as-built verdict, each remediated
finding is retained in the verdict artifact and the shipped record.

### Per-task `Done when:` evidence

Per-task delivery is evidenced at `build` when a task closes: each `Done when:` check parsed from the
plan must be shown true before the task counts as complete (FR-6). A check that cannot be made true under
the approved plan is reported as a plan gap, not repaired off-plan. A plan authored before this change —
with no `Done when:` blocks — closes tasks on the prior evidence rule instead (FR-21).

### Bounded plan growth

The total number of tasks a plan can accumulate after approval is bounded by the authored count plus the
capped remediation additions from `prd_audit` and enabled as-built review remediation (FR-18). Each
gate has its own remediation-lap cap, but both draw from the same plan-growth allowance. `ai-conductor daemon
status` prints a `PLAN GROWTH [<slug>]:` line per in-progress feature — authored count, added count
broken down by gate, and tasks remaining under the cap (FR-19; see [`daemon status`](../reference/cli.md#daemon-status)).

The `build` rework hint for a `testQuality` FAIL carries best-effort `plan contract:` and
`prior attempts:` pointer lines derived from the raw rubric aggregate — a `plan contract:` pointer names the
active plan's owning task for a finding anchored to a plan task or an owned file, and a `prior attempts:`
pointer lists earlier `.pipeline/build-review/<lap>/*.json` findings that share the same canonical anchor.
Pointer derivation is advisory: a missing active plan, an unreadable prior-lap artifact, or an anchor with no
unique matching task yields no pointer for that finding rather than blocking the dispatch. Since a
`build_review` FAIL now routes straight to `build` rather than through `/remediate`, this pointer
derivation is scoped to that rework hint; `/remediate` dispatches are triggered by `prd_audit`, the
as-built review, `finish` verification, and build stalls instead.

Every exit from a `build_review` FAIL block consults the disposition store using the effective verdict, not
only the raw aggregate that first reported the FAIL. An operator `ai-conductor build-review accept` can land
while the remediation planner is composing rework from that raw aggregate (a window of minutes); when
every graded finding is accepted at routing time, the composed rework is dropped and `build_review`
re-lands instead. Its re-run settles from cache, applies the dispositions, and re-dispatches only
infrastructure-failed rubrics. Without this guard a kickback has ordered removal of exactly the surface
the operator had just accepted.

The cache identity also includes the judging engine (adr-2026-08-21): the engine's 12-hex content
stamp and a `sha256:` digest of the rubric's installed `SKILL.md`. A cached judgement made under a
different engine build or edited rubric skill text is discarded (miss reasons
`engine-version-mismatch` / `skill-digest-mismatch`) and re-judged; each discard is a
`build_review_cache_discarded` event in `events.jsonl`, the daemon log, and the audit trail.

Each rubric has a closed engine-owned finding vocabulary, repeated in its provider-facing skill contract:
`testQuality` uses `test-insensitive`. The parser normalizes harmless casing and underscore variation
before validation. A value outside the rubric's vocabulary is rejected and receives the bounded
repair/rerun path below; it cannot become a new finding identity or burn a kickback.

A rubric session that answers but misses the judged-result JSON contract does not burn its dispatch. The
engine embeds the exact per-rubric result schema (including the nested `anchor` object's field names) in
every rubric prompt, and on a shape failure issues exactly one bounded repair invocation — the rejection
diagnosis, the schema, and a capped excerpt of the session's own previous output, asking for the JSON
re-emitted verbatim in shape only. Only when the repair turn also fails does the rubric settle as an
`invalid-provider-result` infrastructure failure, and that failure then carries a bounded (≤2 KB) raw-output
excerpt in its diagnostic detail instead of a bare label.

The graded diff excludes paths the **engine** authors rather than the builder — `.docs/shipped/` and
`.pipeline/`. No plan task can describe harness machinery output, so grading it guarantees a scope
finding the builder cannot legitimately act on.

The graded diff also excludes one file the builder normally does own: the feature's own plan, when its
divergence from the graded base is **exactly** the engine-appended `### Task rem-*` blocks recorded in
`.pipeline/engine-state.json` — the same test the protected-artifact seal applies before it tolerates the
append. Any other amendment (an edited earlier line, an unrecorded task id, added prose) fails that test
and is graded in full. The plan body `prd_audit` and the as-built review judge against is unaffected: it
still carries every appended remediation task, and a `rem-*` task's outcome is bounded by its own text
and never enlarges any other task's outcome — remediation-lap products are inputs to converge on, never a
surface that expands what a later lap must litigate.

The graded diff also excludes paths touched only by feature commits Git identifies as patch-equivalent to
commits already on the resolved review base. This is path-scoped and fail-closed: a path stays graded if a
novel feature commit also touched it, or if the patch-equivalence probe or path attribution cannot establish
the exclusion. The `build_review_base` event payload carries the filtered commit set and excluded paths,
while the daemon log renders its filtered-commit count for the operator.

When a deterministic BUILD verification gate — `test_suite` or any other gate in that group —
fails, the engine accumulates the sanitized failure in `.pipeline/build-review-rebase-repairs.json`.
The ledger is outside rewritten Git history, so repeated rebases retain earlier entries without
treating commit trailers as authority. A failure is attributed to a base advance by joining it
against `rebase_changed` events on `.pipeline/events.jsonl` — the durable, append-only event
spine — requiring both that the failure was observed after the advance and that its diagnostic
overlaps a path the advance changed. A bare time-window match is not enough: overlap is required
so a genuinely unplanned deletion is never laundered as a repair. This join replaces an earlier,
transient signal (a `kickback` field on the gate's own verdict file) that a later run of the same
gate silently overwrote.

The ledger and the `build_review_repair_context` telemetry event it fed were judgement context for the
retired `scope` and `tautology` rubrics; the retained `testQuality` rubric does not consume either. Both
mechanisms are retained as dead weight rather than removed, since the ledger itself is populated
independently of `build_review` (`test-suite-remediation.ts` reads it during rebase repair).

### Operator-authorized protected-artifact reseals

An [`ai-conductor reseal`](../reference/cli.md#ai-conductor-reseal) an operator runs mid-feature writes a new
baseline at the current commit and appends a `rebaselines` entry to
`.pipeline/protected-artifact-seal.json` recording the trigger (`operator-reseal`) and rationale, and a
`protected_artifact_reseal` audit record with an `operator` origin — so the override is auditable rather
than silent. The reseal is consulted by the protected-artifact seal check itself (a resealed path is no
longer refused as a feature-authored DECIDE change once the seal rebaselines onto a later merge base)
and, together with every feature commit's `Scope:` trailer rationales, supplied to `prd_audit` as
immutable `OVER_SCOPE` intent evidence to judge, not an instruction to follow — an operator claim it
still has to weigh against the PRD's or stories' stated intent. The reseal rationale is not rendered
into the retained `testQuality` rubric's prompt, since `testQuality` judges tests, not plan or scope
conformance.

Kickback counting is untouched by the consolidation — a `build_review` FAIL routed to `build` counts
against the per-gate cap like any other.

### Post-join build-review adjudication

For a current aggregate FAIL, the daemon normally runs one `remediate` judgement after the rubric
join. The judgement receives the complete unresolved finding set and the feature's prior case history;
it does not replace the raw verdict in `.pipeline/build-review.json` or the operator's exact-finding
dispositions. `build_review.adjudication.enabled: false` retains the legacy raw-FAIL route.

The engine validates the judgement as a complete source-to-case mapping, assigns durable case and
effect identities, and records the feature-local state before applying an effect. An action publishes
a durable BUILD work order and returns to `build`; a justified deferral files or reuses its marked
intake issue; a rejection has no external effect. A `refute` row can instead settle an already attempted
action case once: it must bind that case, carry high-confidence path/excerpt evidence and at least one
refuted assertion, and changes the case to a resolved refutation without charging another BUILD route.
It emits `remediation_case_refuted`. A refutation may retain only a complete deferral for a narrow
remainder; the refuted source settles only after that residual is applied, while a reserved or failed
residual remains blocking. A second refutation of the same case halts `needs-human`. In a mixed lap,
an action route takes precedence while an uncovered infrastructure failure remains blocking after the
BUILD attempt. Invalid, incomplete, stale, repeated, or unfinished case state halts rather than silently
routing or passing.

The case store and work order survive a daemon restart. BUILD stamps the work order before it starts,
so an already attempted case cannot receive another free route; a later clean review settles cases
whose sources are absent. Inspect the durable state and lifecycle events in
[`artifacts`](../reference/artifacts.md#verdict-and-evidence-artifacts) when diagnosing a halt.

Not every gate reruns on retry. For the three judged SHIP gates, a genuine fresh non-passing decision routes
immediately, while an identical repeat on provably unchanged inputs only routes on the second attempt —
retrying a judgement that already looked at the same bytes is not progress.

**A step's own refusal ends the run.** A step that decides its work cannot honestly be done — say
`acceptance_specs` finding that the accepted DECIDE artifacts contradict already-merged code — can write
`.pipeline/HALT` with a `needs-human` `.pipeline/HALT.class` and refuse. When an attempt settles with such a
marker, the run stops and surfaces that HALT's own body as the halt reason, instead of spending the rest of
the retry budget re-dispatching the same unresolvable condition and reporting a generic gate miss. Only a
marker that appeared or changed during that attempt counts: `.pipeline/HALT` persists across steps and runs,
so a leftover marker from earlier work never suppresses a legitimate retry, and anything ambiguous is treated
as leftover.

**Exhausted but working.** A `build` step whose retry budget runs out is not automatically a wedge. Three
signals do three distinct jobs, and none substitutes for another: the attributed-task count is advisory
routing and telemetry, commit movement is the liveness authority, and `build_review` is the sole completion
authority. So when the budget exhausts but at least one attempt moved HEAD — real work landed, just without
a `Task:` trailer attributing it — the run routes through the same advance seam a completed build uses,
straight into `build_review`, instead of the generic "retries exhausted" halt, **but only when the
worktree is clean**. Dirty paths keep the build halted so they can be committed or discarded; they never
ride the commit-movement route. Which plan task ids were left unresolved is recorded in
`conduct-state.json` so the decision stays visible. This is not an always-pass:
`build_review` re-grades the diff against the plan on its own evidence and can still FAIL, kicking the build
back under the same per-gate kickback cap as any other `build_review` kickback, so repeated route→FAIL
cycles — including no-op commits offered as movement — are bounded exactly like everything else. A build
with zero commit movement across every attempt never routes; it keeps the ordinary remediation-then-halt
path.

When routing runs out, the run writes a halt marker and stops. See [stalled or stuck
feature](../runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md).

## Waivers

Two gates accept a committed waiver: the self-host release gate and the land-time coherence gate. Both use
the same file idiom — a `Waives:` line and a non-empty `Rationale:` — and both parse strictly: a missing
line, an empty gap list, an empty rationale, or an unrecognized name makes the waiver malformed, and a
malformed waiver is never silently accepted.

| | Release waiver | Coherence waiver |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Directory | `.docs/release-waivers/` | `.docs/coherence-waivers/` |
| Vocabulary | fixed — four canonical breaking-surface names | dynamic — only gap ids the validator actually reported for this change set |
| Waives | a breaking-surface classification that is internal-only in fact | a coverage gap the author can justify |

Three rules apply to both, and they are what makes a waiver a record rather than an escape hatch:

- **Freshness.** The waiver must be added or modified in *this* change set. A waiver merged by a prior
  feature never satisfies a later one. Without this, one waiver would permanently disarm a gate.
- **Total coverage.** A waiver must cover every classified surface or reported gap. Partial coverage blocks,
  and the failure names the gap that is still uncovered.
- **Some things are unwaivable.** A fabricated identifier cited in a legacy traceability row, a malformed
  criterion row, or a stories artifact with no parseable criteria is an evidentiary defect, not a coverage
  gap, and no waiver clears it. An undeterminable change set cannot be waived either — the gate does not
  know what it would be waiving. And a change that genuinely alters CLI, hook, or schema behavior needs a
  real migration block, not a waiver.

## What a gate is not

Three things in this repo are easy to conflate and are not the same:

- **Gates** block a feature's progression. This page.
- **The integrity suite** validates the harness repo's own structure before a commit —
  [validation](../contributing/validation.md).
- **The release gate** is one self-host gate that happens to run the integrity suite as its first sub-check
  — [releases](../contributing/releases.md).

Per-step enforcement values and skip rules: [steps](../reference/steps.md). Gate-related config keys:
[configuration](../reference/configuration.md).

## Directory hints in build review

A plan Files entry ending in `/` describes a directory, not a source file. Build review does not
read it as a Git blob or seed dependency discovery from it. Changed test files beneath that directory
still enter review through the pinned Git diff; explicit test-file entries still seed discovery.
Missing required source blobs and invalid file paths continue to block review.

### Test-quality candidate references

A reviewer may cite a resolved candidate using the source-region reference supplied by the engine.
When that reference identifies exactly one validated candidate, the engine translates it to the
existing test-title and occurrence identity before validating the finding. This prevents a source
hash versus title hash mismatch from discarding an otherwise actionable review. Shared source
references require a canonical test reference; excluded, indeterminate, or foreign regions remain
rejected. Finding identities, prior dispositions, and the substantive test-quality verdict do not
change.
