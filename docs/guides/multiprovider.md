# Choose and configure the LLM host

Select which host executes your steps — `claude`, `codex`, or an ordered fallback between them —
and verify the selection took effect. For operators who have installed the harness and registered a
project.

Exactly two hosts are built in. They are registered by the engine at startup as
`llm_provider:claude` and `llm_provider:codex`. Anything else is a plugin.

## Prerequisites

- The host CLI you intend to use is on `PATH`: `claude --version`, `codex --version`, or both.
- The project is registered and has a project root you can write `.ai-conductor/config.yml` into.
- For `codex`, an authenticated Codex login or `CODEX_API_KEY` in the environment.

## 1. Understand what selects a host

There is **no `--provider` CLI flag**. Selection lives entirely in the `llm_provider` config key.

| Where | Key | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run level | `llm_provider` | every step in the run |
| Step level | `steps.<step>.llm_provider` | that step only, merged ahead of the run-level list |

The default when the key is absent is `['claude']`.

`bin/install --providers=claude,codex` does **not** set this. It gates only the install-time
readiness report — a line per selected host saying whether its CLI was found. Both skill catalogs
(`~/.claude/skills` for Claude, `~/.agents/skills` for Codex) are symlinked on every install
regardless of the value, and the flag never writes into any config file.

Both catalogs also contain `HARNESS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` symlinks to the installed
harness checkout. The latter keeps optional architecture references resolvable beside
`HARNESS.md`; it is not loaded automatically. Install and update create or refresh these links,
`--check` diagnoses missing, broken, stale, or duplicate references without changing them, and
uninstall removes owned links while preserving operator-owned entries.

## 2. Set the host

`llm_provider` is read from the **project** config — `<project>/.ai-conductor/config.yml` — for
both `ai-conductor inline` and `ai-conductor daemon`. The user-level `~/.ai-conductor/config.yml` is
merged only for the mermaid-renderer setting, so an `llm_provider` written there has no effect on
step execution.

Create or edit the project config:

```yaml
# <project>/.ai-conductor/config.yml
llm_provider: codex
```

`ai-conductor create <name>` includes this file for a new repository. In an existing Git repository,
run `ai-conductor config init`; the command writes the project-safe template once and preserves an
existing config byte-for-byte. Every key is documented in
[../reference/configuration.md](../reference/configuration.md).

**Observable outcome:** the next `ai-conductor inline` run dispatches steps to `codex` instead of
`claude`. An unknown name fails fast at startup:

```text
llm_provider names unknown provider "gpt". Available registered providers: claude, codex
```

The same validation runs against every `steps.<step>.llm_provider` entry, reporting the offending
path.

## 3. Add a fallback ladder

An ordered array is a fallback ladder, tried left to right:

```yaml
llm_provider:
  - claude
  - codex
```

The engine walks the list and stops at the first host that produces a result. It advances to the
next entry only on **unavailability**, not on ordinary step failure:

- run-scoped provider unavailability — the binary is missing (`ENOENT` or exit `127`), or the host
  reports an auth/credit condition that makes the whole run impossible;
- model unavailability, but only after that host's own internal model ladder is exhausted.

A step that runs and fails on its merits ends the run there. It does not silently re-run on the
other host.

**Observable outcome:** on a fallback, the run logs

```text
Step <step>: provider claude unavailable (<reason>); falling back to codex.
```

When every candidate is unavailable the step fails with
`All configured providers are unavailable for step <step>: <provider> (<reason>); …`.

Duplicates are collapsed, preserving first-occurrence order.

## 4. Override a single step

A step-level selection is prepended to the run-level list rather than replacing it, so the
run-level hosts remain as fallbacks:

```yaml
llm_provider:
  - claude
steps:
  build:
    llm_provider: codex
```

`build` tries `codex`, then `claude`. Every other step tries `claude` only. Step names come from
[../reference/steps.md](../reference/steps.md).

## What differs between the two hosts

| Aspect | `claude` | `codex` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Executable | `claude` (fixed) | `$CODEX_EXECUTABLE`, default `codex` |
| Skill catalog | `~/.claude/skills` | `~/.agents/skills` |
| Project instruction file | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Skill invocation syntax | `/skill-name` | `$skill-name` |
| Explicit-only metadata | `disable-model-invocation: true` in `SKILL.md` | `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml` |
| Interactive steps | a real REPL | none — `codex exec` is one-shot, streamed as JSONL |
| Readiness check | none; failures are classified from process signals and output | explicit `codex doctor --json --summary` before every dispatch, failing closed |
| Isolated-home variable | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | `CODEX_HOME` |
| Model table | Claude-specific | Codex-specific |

Both hosts share one skill corpus; only the invocation syntax and the discovery directory differ.
Model and effort resolution per host is owned by [../reference/models.md](../reference/models.md);
the environment variables above are enumerated in
[../reference/environment.md](../reference/environment.md).

Catalog discovery does not imply permission to invoke. Most harness skills are explicit-only on both
hosts: the operator or engine can still activate them with the native syntax, but the model cannot
select them merely because their description resembles an unrelated request. The small set of
same-session dependencies intentionally omits both host controls; the exhaustive classification and
its rationale are in [the skills reference](../reference/skills.md#invocation-policy).

`--interactive` is honored differently as a consequence: under `codex` there is no REPL to open, so
conversational steps stream a single one-shot run instead of handing you a prompt.

### The Codex skills directory moved

`~/.agents/skills` is the active Codex catalog. `~/.codex/skills` is the former discovery location,
and `bin/install` reconciles it — harness-owned symlinks there are **deleted** once the active
catalog is established. Foreign entries are preserved and reported with a warning. If you had an
older install, expect harness links under `~/.codex/skills` to disappear on your next
`./bin/install`; that is the reconciliation, not a failure. `./bin/install --check` reports any
skill present in both locations as a duplicate-discovery error and exits `1`.

### The composer loop always uses Claude

`ai-conductor compose` spawns `claude` directly with `/composer` as its prompt. It does not consult
`llm_provider`. Setting `llm_provider: codex` changes which host executes pipeline steps; it does
not change the host for the interactive idea→spec loop, which still requires the `claude` CLI. See
[engineer-loop.md](engineer-loop.md).

## Verify the selection

`install` is not on `PATH` — run it from the harness checkout:

```bash
cd <harness-checkout>
./bin/install --check
```

It reports a found/not-found line for each host named by `--providers` (defaulting to `claude`),
plus the state of both skill catalogs. Exit codes are in [../quickstart.md](../quickstart.md).

A missing binary surfaces at dispatch time with a symmetric message from either host:

```text
LLM provider 'codex' not found. Install it or check your PATH.
```

A Codex readiness failure reports its own remediation instead — for example
`The selected Codex authentication source is not configured. Sign in to Codex and retry.` for an
unconfigured login, or `Replace CODEX_API_KEY and restart the daemon.` when the API-key source was
selected.

## Third-party hosts

A host that is not built in loads as a plugin. The engine scans two directories at startup, global
first, then project-local, which shadows it on the same kind and name:

1. `~/.ai-conductor/plugins/<name>/plugin.yml`
2. `<project>/.ai-conductor/plugins/<name>/plugin.yml`

A manifest requires three fields — `kind: llm_provider`, a `name` matching `[a-z0-9-]+`, and an
`entrypoint` — and may declare an optional `harness_version` range. Once registered, the name is
usable in `llm_provider` exactly like `claude` or `codex`. An `llm_provider` entrypoint must export
`invoke`. The engine selects an operator-facing interactive dispatch through
`InvokeOptions.interactive`; plugins do not implement a separate interactive method.

An invalid manifest is skipped with a warning. An incompatible `harness_version` or a missing or
malformed entrypoint aborts startup rather than degrading silently.

The `plugins/` directory at the harness repo root is **reference material only and is never
auto-loaded** — it holds `recorder-provider` (`llm_provider:recorder`) and
`json-stdout-subscriber` (`ui_renderer:json-stdout`) as worked examples. To use one, copy or
symlink it into one of the two discovery directories above. Neither is needed for normal operation.
Writing a provider plugin is covered in [../contributing/extending.md](../contributing/extending.md).
