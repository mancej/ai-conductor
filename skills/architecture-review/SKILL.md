## Purpose

Reviews the design through an architectural lens BEFORE stories are written and before any code.
Catches technical infeasibility, hidden complexity, architectural drift, and domain violations
early — when they're cheap to fix. This is where the *how* is resolved (so the PRD stays
product-only) and captured as APPROVED ADRs.

Read the `Scope boundary:` from `.docs/track/<slug>.md` as binding; preserve the confirmed narrow/comprehensive breadth outcome; do not permit a materially broader expansion beyond it unless the operator confirms before it enters the artifact.

**Run after `/prd` (product track) or `/explore` (technical track), and BEFORE `/stories`** (adr-2026-06-29-architecture-before-stories-convergent-kickback).
The review's input is the PRD's functional requirements (product) or the explore output + technical
intent (technical) — stories and the plan do not exist yet at this point.

Also invocable at pipeline batch boundaries to verify implementation stays architecturally sound.

**Correctness gate:** an ADR is the most load-bearing artifact in the flow — everything downstream
builds on it. Apply the `/verify-claims` protocol before writing any APPROVED ADR: state each
technical claim with a grounded confidence % and its basis (verified vs inferred), surface every
assumption the design rests on, and HARD-BLOCK (operator approval interactive, HALT if autonomous)
on any unconfirmed assumption that would change the decision. Do not record a decision as APPROVED
while it rests on an unconfirmed load-bearing assumption.

### Provider-native delegation

When this review delegates exploration or analysis, use the selected host's available subagent facility.
Preserve the scope limits, evidence, ADR output, and veto/gate behavior regardless of host.
**Claude delegation:** Claude uses the Agent tool; any Claude model choice is confined to
that facility. A Codex-selected run uses its available subagent facility and configured Codex
provider policy, without translating Claude model names.

### Full vs amendment mode (convergence — adr-2026-06-29-architecture-before-stories-convergent-kickback)

- **Full pass** — the pre-stories run above: full feasibility/alignment, produces APPROVED ADRs.
- **Amendment pass** — when a later step (`stories` or `conflict-check`) re-opens architecture with a
  specific **structural** gap, address ONLY that gap; do not re-derive the design from scratch. This
  is what makes the loop converge instead of oscillate.

Only a genuine structural gap (a missing component/seam/boundary) may re-open architecture — never a
story-phrasing nit or a coverage gap. The conductor caps re-openings and HALTs for a human on excess.

**Accepted-artifact amendment:** When this review concludes that an accepted DECIDE assertion is
falsified, amend that non-story artifact during the DECIDE pass; do not instruct a later phase to
make the change. Add this note beside the original assertion:

```markdown
> **Amended YYYY-MM-DD by #NNN:** <what the assertion now says, and why>
```

For every non-story artifact, the note is additive: the original assertion remains preserved; never
rewrite or delete it, and create no separate record. Story artifacts under `.docs/stories/` are the
exception: replace superseded assertions in place without an amendment record. The amended artifact is
then part of the spec-branch baseline before BUILD begins.

### Lightweight Mode (Medium Complexity Tier)

When the feature is classified as **Medium** by `/conduct`'s complexity assessment, run only:
- **Section 2: Technical Feasibility** — full check
- **Section 4: Architectural Alignment** — full check

Skip:
- Section 3 (Complexity Assessment) — already done by `/conduct`
- Section 5 (Domain Integrity Pre-Check) — handled by TDD domain reviewer per-cycle
- Section 7 (mandatory ADR creation) — only create ADRs for genuinely novel architectural decisions

**Explore agent limits for Medium tier:** Max 2 agents with non-overlapping scopes:
- Agent 1: the PRD/spec (`.docs/specs/`) — its FRs are the review input (stories/plan don't exist yet)
- Agent 2: relevant source files for the feature area
- Do NOT dispatch agents solely to read `.memory/`; this active workflow reads relevant entries
  directly when it needs them
- Do NOT dispatch a third agent for decisions/ADRs (read `.docs/decisions/` directly if needed)

For **Small** features, the DECIDE-time architecture review is skipped by `/conduct`. This does
not skip the §12 as-built compliance gate at SHIP.
For **Large** features, run the full review (all sections).

## Practices

### 1. Load Architecture Context

Read in order of authority (higher overrides lower):

1. `.docs/decisions/` — ADRs are the authoritative architecture reference
2. `.docs/architecture/` — C4 diagrams (system context, containers, components, ERD, sequences)
3. `CLAUDE.md` — Project conventions and constraints
4. `.memory/decisions/` — Prior architectural decisions
5. Existing code structure — `config/routes.rb`, model relationships, directory layout

**Approved decisions first; convention over precedent:** Applicable APPROVED decisions override
observed patterns. Existing code that conflicts with a documented decision is tech debt and must
be rejected as precedent. Never downgrade a finding because "the codebase already does it this
way."

**Focused local pattern basis (when applicable):** When a concrete local precedent matters to a
feature concern that approved decisions do not already settle, record it in the review's ordinary
prose. Keep the basis bounded to that concern and include:

- the precedent's role;
- the material semantic traits the new work should preserve;
- why that precedent applies to this concern;
- the variation that remains allowed; and
- path and stable-symbol hints that help BUILD rediscover an equivalent on its current HEAD.

Hints are rediscovery seeds, not authoring-time snapshots: never anchor this basis to line numbers
or require the original exemplar to remain at a fixed coordinate. BUILD must resolve the traits
against its checkout at implementation time. A selected pattern does not establish a project-wide
convention or configuration rule, and it does not replace the separate exact-replication
`Pattern-source` / `Rename-map` contract.

When no suitable precedent can be verified, record that verified no-fit in the ordinary review
prose rather than inventing an exemplar. When the in-scope approach requires departing from an
otherwise applicable pattern, record the operator-authorized bounded departure, its reason, and
its boundary before handing the approach to BUILD. Do not add this optional basis when no local
precedent affects the approach.

### 2. Technical Feasibility

For each story in the plan, assess:

| Check | Question | Flag If |
|---|---|---|
| **Stack compatibility** | Can this be built with the current stack? | Requires new gems/packages, external services, or infrastructure changes |
| **Prerequisites** | What must exist before this can start? | Migrations, config changes, external account setup needed |
| **Integration surface** | What other systems/modules does this touch? | Crosses 3+ module boundaries or hits external APIs |
| **Data implications** | Schema changes, migrations, data backfills? | Large table migrations, breaking schema changes, data loss risk |
| **Performance risk** | Will this create N+1s, unbounded queries, heavy computation? | List endpoints without pagination, missing indexes on query paths |
| **Worktree isolation** | Can this run in parallel worktrees without conflicts? | New Docker services, ports, databases, or shared state without `.env` boundary pattern |

### 3. Complexity Assessment

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Low** | 1 model, 1 endpoint, no external deps | Proceed |
| **Medium** | 2–3 models, cross-model logic, background jobs | Proceed with boundary attention |
| **High** | 4+ models, external APIs, complex state machines | Consider splitting |
| **Spike** | Unknown tech, unclear requirements, novel patterns | Time-box spike before planning |

### 4. Architectural Alignment

Check stories and plan against documented architecture:

**Domain boundaries:**
- Does the story respect existing module/domain boundaries?
- Does it introduce coupling between domains that should be independent?
- Are database queries staying within their domain, or reaching across to other domains' tables?

**Pattern consistency:**
- Does the implementation approach match existing patterns (service objects, concerns, etc.)?
- If it establishes a new structural pattern, is there an ADR justifying the departure?

**State management:**
- Can invalid states be represented in the proposed data model?
- Are state transitions explicit (enum/state machine) or implicit (boolean flags)?
- Does the proposal use `is_*` boolean flags where an enum would prevent invalid combinations?

**Diagram accuracy:**
- Do architecture diagrams in `.docs/architecture/` reflect the current architecture?
- If new containers, services, or external integrations have been added, are diagrams updated?
- Reference diagrams when assessing domain boundaries and coupling.

**Worktree isolation:**
- Does the new infrastructure use the `.env` / `.env.local` boundary pattern?
- Are new services added to shared infrastructure (Docker) or per-worktree?
- If new ports or databases are introduced, are they parameterized via environment variables?
- Would two worktrees running simultaneously conflict on any resource (port, DB name, file path, queue name)?

**Security boundaries:**
- Are new endpoints authenticated and authorized?
- Does the data model expose sensitive fields that should be filtered?
- Are there new user inputs that need validation at the boundary?

**Production DI defaults:**
- Verify that production dependency injection defaults use persistent stores (PostgreSQL,
  Redis, filesystem) — not in-memory implementations
- Flag any `InMemory*`, `Fake*`, or `Stub*` class registered as a production default
- **BLOCKED if production DI defaults use in-memory stores for stateful data** — this means
  data loss on restart and test/prod divergence when acceptance tests override DI

### 5. Domain Integrity Pre-Check

Before implementation begins, check the plan for domain modeling issues:

| Principle | Check | Veto If |
|---|---|---|
| **No primitive obsession** | Plan uses domain types, not raw strings/ints | IDs, statuses, money, or email stored as primitives |
| **Parse, don't validate** | Validation at construction, trusted types throughout | Plan validates same field in multiple places |
| **Invalid states unrepresentable** | Type system prevents impossible combinations | Booleans where enums should exist, nullable fields that must be present |
| **Semantic types** | Types answer "what IS this?" not "what is this LIKE?" | `NonEmptyString` instead of `UserName` |
| **Exhaustive matching** | No catch-all defaults for domain states | `else` / `default` on status/type switches |

### 6. Risk Register

```markdown
| Risk | Type | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concurrent moves corrupt positions | Data | Medium | High | Row-level locking in transaction |
```

Risk types: **Technical**, **Integration**, **Data**, **Performance**, **Security**, **Knowledge**

### 7. ADR Creation — Structural Prerequisite and Decision Categories

A new ADR is warranted only for a real structural decision. Structural change is a necessary
prerequisite: decision categories never independently require an ADR. First determine whether the
proposal establishes or revises one of these durable architectural shapes:

- a system boundary, including a bounded context or deployment boundary;
- component or service decomposition, including merging services or assigning cross-module ownership;
- an integration pattern, including an external API seam, anti-corruption layer, or asynchronous callback boundary;
- state or data architecture, including a persistence model, event-store boundary, or durable state-transition design; or
- foundational technology, including a runtime, framework, database, messaging, queuing, or caching platform.

Use the categories only after that structural prerequisite is met, to make the decision explicit
and reviewable. Importance, breadth, workflow policy, prompt wording, and ordinary implementation detail
are not sufficient ADR triggers. A small change may still warrant an ADR when it makes one
of the structural decisions above; a broad or important change does not when it does not.

Before drafting, read `.docs/decisions/` for an APPROVED ADR that already governs the structural
decision. Reuse an existing governing ADR rather than duplicate it. Cite and apply it when it
covers the proposal; draft a new ADR only for an uncovered structural decision, or supersede the
existing ADR when the structural decision itself changes.

**ADR format:** Use `templates/adr.md.template`. Name each ADR
`.docs/decisions/adr-YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab-slug>.md` — date plus a short descriptive slug — and title it
`# ADR: <title>` (the heading carries **no** number). **Never use a sequential number, in the
filename or the heading:**

- ❌ WRONG: `adr-0001-ci-fix.md` with heading `# ADR-0001: …`
- ✅ RIGHT: `adr-2026-07-20-ci-fix.md` with heading `# ADR: …`

Sequential numbers collide when parallel worktrees each grab "the next number"; the date+slug never
collides and IS the ADR's identifier — cite the **filename stem** (never a number) when superseding
or referencing one. If two ADRs land on the same date, the slug disambiguates. This applies to newly
created ADRs only — existing numbered ADRs keep their names (append-only). (A deterministic gate to
reject number-named ADRs is tracked in intake #705.)
ADRs are append-only — supersede, don't delete. Every claim about external dependency behavior
must cite specific evidence (documentation, tested behavior, or source code).

**Lightweight mode (Medium tier):** Apply the same structural prerequisite and reuse check. Do not
skip an ADR merely because the feature is medium-sized, but do not create one merely because a
category label, feature size, or importance is present.

**GATE: If a proposed change makes an uncovered structural decision above, architecture-review
MUST create an ADR before implementation proceeds. An architecture review that creates or omits an
ADR without first applying the structural prerequisite and governing-ADR reuse check is incomplete.**

### 7b. ADR Approval Lifecycle

ADRs follow a three-phase lifecycle. No ADR becomes authoritative without human approval.
Terminal ADR declarations use only `Status: APPROVED` or `Status: SUPERSEDED by <adr-filename-stem>`.

**Phase 1: DRAFT**
- Architecture-review creates the ADR with `Status: DRAFT` in the frontmatter
- DRAFT ADRs are written to `.docs/decisions/` as `adr-YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab-slug>.md` (see §7)
- DRAFT ADRs cannot be cited as justification in code review, evaluator verdicts, or
  implementation decisions — they are proposals, not decisions

**Phase 2: REVIEW**
- All DRAFT ADRs created during architecture-review are presented to the user for approval
  via `review_artifacts` (clear screen, one at a time)
- When an ADR contains a Mermaid diagram and a `mermaid_renderer` is configured
  (`~/.ai-conductor/config.yml`), `review_artifacts` renders it to a visual so the user
  approves what they can see; with no renderer it falls back to the raw Markdown (never blocks)
- The user approves, rejects (launches interactive Claude to revise), or requests changes
- On approval, status is updated to `Status: APPROVED` and the ADR becomes authoritative
- On rejection, the ADR is revised in-place and re-presented until approved

**Phase 3: AUTHORITATIVE**
- Only `Status: APPROVED` ADRs are binding on downstream work
- Pipeline evaluators, code review, and `/finish` gates may cite APPROVED ADRs
- If a subsequent feature conflicts with an APPROVED ADR, the conflict must be resolved by
  either superseding the ADR (new ADR with `Supersedes: <old>`) or changing the implementation
- Superseded ADRs get `Status: SUPERSEDED` and a `Superseded by:` reference

**HARD GATE: No feature proceeds past architecture-review with DRAFT ADRs. All ADRs created
during the review must reach APPROVED status before `/writing-system-tests` can begin.**

### 8. Output

Write the review to `.docs/decisions/architecture-review-YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`:

```markdown
# Architecture Review: [Feature Name]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Stories reviewed:** [list]
**Verdict:** APPROVED | APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS | BLOCKED

## Feasibility
## Complexity
## Alignment
## Domain Integrity
## Wiring Surface (required for Medium/Large tier — see below; omit for Small)
## Risks
## ADRs Created
## Conditions (if APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS)
## Blocking Issues (if BLOCKED)
```

**Wiring Surface (design-time, Medium/Large tier only):** For each new production surface
the feature introduces (exported function/module, hook script, config key, emitted event,
scheduled job, CLI subcommand, etc.), state at design time where/how it will be called from
in production — e.g. "invoked from the daemon loop's step dispatcher," "wired into
`ai-conductor`'s command table," "consumed by the existing event bus subscriber in
`src/x.ts`." This is a design-time commitment, not a code citation — no `file:line` is
required yet since the code doesn't exist. It informs the review's feasibility and overlap
analysis; it is not a per-task plan contract.

This is **DESIGN-TIME ONLY**. It does not affect, duplicate, or substitute for the §12
As-Built Compliance Gate's production reachability sweep, which independently verifies the
*shipped* code against real `file:line` callers after implementation. Leave §12 untouched —
the two checks run at different phases against different evidence (a stated intent here vs.
an observed caller there).

Not required for **Small** tier features (the DECIDE-time review is skipped for Small per the
Lightweight Mode section above; §12 still runs at SHIP).

**Early overlap scan (Medium/Large tier):** Before `/plan` runs, run `ai-conductor overlap-scan
--files <Wiring Surface candidate paths>` over the paths named in `## Wiring Surface` above.
Surface the rendered report to the author alongside the review output. This is **advisory
only** — it never blocks the verdict or the review — it exists to flag unmerged dependent
work touching the same files before `/plan` locks in a task breakdown that could collide
with it.

### 9. Verdict Enforcement

**APPROVED** — Proceed to `/writing-system-tests`.

**APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** — Proceed; conditions tracked in the plan. Evaluator checks at code review. Unmet conditions at `/finish` are blocking.

**BLOCKED** — Pipeline HALTS. Present to the user: what is violated, resolution options with trade-offs, and which ADRs are in conflict. The user must explicitly approve a resolution. Do not auto-resolve. Capture the resolution as a new ADR only when resolving it makes or changes a structural decision; resolve non-structural blockers without an ADR. Re-run the review.

### 10. Recurring Review (Pipeline Batch Boundaries)

At pipeline batch boundaries, perform a lightweight architecture check:

- Has the implementation drifted from the approved plan?
- Have new structural patterns been introduced without an ADR?
- Are domain boundaries being respected in the actual code?
- Are architecture diagrams still accurate after this batch's changes?
- Escalation: non-blocking findings that appear in 2+ consecutive reviews become blocking

If drift is detected at a batch boundary:
1. For drift that makes or changes a structural decision, write a new ADR documenting what changed and why (or that it was unintentional); otherwise record the drift without creating an ADR
2. If the drift violates a prior ADR: BLOCK — human must decide whether to update the ADR
   or revert the code

### 11. Signal Review Requirement

Before exiting, decide whether the conductor should prompt the user to review
the architecture report and ADRs. Review mode for this step is **conditional** —
auto-approved unless you write a marker file.

Write `.pipeline/review-required-architecture_review` (any content; the file's
existence is the signal) if ANY of the following is true:

- Verdict is **APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS** or **BLOCKED**
- Any new ADR was drafted (DRAFT ADRs must be approved before they become authoritative)
- Any existing ADR was superseded
- Any risk with Impact=High was entered in the Risk Register
- Batch-boundary review found drift from the approved plan

If the verdict is a clean **APPROVED** with zero new/superseded ADRs and no
High-impact risks, do NOT write the marker — the conductor auto-approves and
moves to the next step.

```bash
# Example: write the marker when review flagged issues
mkdir -p .pipeline
echo "verdict: APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS, new ADRs: 2" > .pipeline/review-required-architecture_review
```

### 12. As-Built Compliance Gate (`--as-built` mode)

Invoked at **SHIP** as `/architecture-review --as-built`, a member of the concurrent
validation group — fanned out alongside `/manual-test` and `/prd-audit` in daemon/auto
runs; in interactive runs it runs serially, after `/prd-audit` and before `/finish`.
It runs for **every feature**, including Small features and features whose DECIDE-time
architecture review was skipped. This is the final architectural drift sweep. It is lightweight —
it does **no** new design or feasibility/complexity assessment, and reuses the drift logic of §10
(Recurring Review) and the ADR lifecycle of §7b.

**Per-check policy:** Read the supplied `AS-BUILT CHECK POLICY` before reviewing. Apply every
check marked `on`, do not infer obligations from a check marked `off`, and record each off check
with its supplied reason. By default, `reachability` and `planGap` apply at every tier;
`adrCompliance` applies only when APPROVED ADRs exist; and `diagramDrift` applies only when
diagrams exist. Operator configuration can disable any check for a tier. Missing ADRs or diagrams
therefore disable only their respective check — never this SHIP gate.

**Relationship to BUILD-time judgement:** [ADR: The build_review wiring rubric is
retired](../../.docs/decisions/adr-2026-08-14-retire-build-review-wiring-rubric.md) removes static
reachability from the BUILD gate, superseding the relocation made by
[adr-2026-08-11](../../.docs/decisions/adr-2026-08-11-wiring-judged-in-build-review.md). BUILD no
longer judges reachability at all. This §12 sweep is unchanged: when it runs at SHIP, it
independently verifies the approved architecture against the shipped source and remains
authoritative for the SHIP compliance verdict. It never relied on BUILD proof as authority.

**Scope (only this):**
- For `adrCompliance`, load only the **APPROVED** ADRs (`.docs/decisions/`, `Status: APPROVED`).
  DRAFT/SUPERSEDED ADRs are not authoritative and are not gated against (per §7b). For
  `diagramDrift`, compare the shipped code with the approved architecture diagrams
  (`.docs/architecture/`).
- For each enabled check, compare the shipped source with its governing evidence: new structural
  patterns without an ADR, domain-boundary violations, or diagram drift are relevant only when the
  corresponding check is on.
- **Production reachability sweep (green-but-unwired guard).** For each primitive this
  feature's diff introduces or materially changes — exported functions/modules, hook scripts,
  config keys, emitted events, ADR-promised log lines — trace ONE invocation path from a real
  production entry point (`ai-conductor` command dispatch, the daemon loop, hook/settings provisioning,
  a wired step runner) and cite the caller as `file:line`. Test files, fixtures, and the
  primitive's own module do not count as callers, except for the narrow same-file composition
  case below.
  - **Narrow same-file composition exception.** Independently verify the complete **root-to-caller-to-export** chain in the current shipped source: a configured production
    entry point reaches the defining module through non-test edges; an actual production caller in
    that module references the exact changed export. Derive that caller from current source rather
    than from a plan declaration. Cite the root/module chain and caller-to-export reference as `file:line`.
    A same-file exception passes only with an exact caller-to-export reference and a production-entry-point root chain.
    An own-module caller alone, module reachability alone, or a name/text match alone does not count.
    This exception never permits a dead helper, a test-only path, a shadowed binding, or an
    unavailable/ambiguous reachability analysis to pass.
  - **Current-source authority.** A persisted BUILD `same-file-composition` proof is corroborating context only, never authority for this SHIP review. Re-resolve the root-to-caller-to-export
    chain against current shipped source at the reviewed HEAD. A stale BUILD proof does not count or pass the exception; neither does a missing current-source hop or changed caller/export.
  - **No production caller exists** → this is a **BLOCKED** violation ("unreachable rung"), same
    severity as an ADR violation: shipped-tested-green code nothing invokes is not shipped
    behavior. Name the primitive and what was searched.
  - **Statically reachable but not yet observed running** (e.g. a new log line no production log
    shows yet) → record it under Drift Notes as `UNEXERCISED: <primitive> — signature: <the
    greppable line/event that will prove it live>`. Not blocking; the signature tells a later
    observer exactly what proves the behavior live in production.
  - The failure shapes this exists to catch: an event callback shipped with no caller anywhere;
    a capability wired into one of its several consumers while the rest silently kept the old
    behavior; a primary code path whose fallback carries 100% of production traffic because the
    primary's precondition is never produced. All are green under unit tests and invisible to a
    conformance-only review.
- **Plan-gap check.** When the shipped code faithfully implements the approved design but that
  design is itself the limit that prevents an outcome the sealed story criteria require, issue
  `PLAN_GAP`. Record the affected outcome and whether it was delivered; do not send unplanned work
  back to BUILD.
  - **Outcome authority: the sealed story criteria.** The approved, sealed acceptance criteria under
    `.docs/stories/` are this feature's acceptance contract and the only authority for what outcome
    was stated. `.docs/intake/` is an idea capture that is **superseded** once stories are approved;
    never grade the shipped code against it. Where intake and the stories disagree, the stories win:
    a deliberate narrowing recorded in an amended, resealed story is the decision, not a plan gap.
- **Context budget.** This review runs late in a long session and providers with a ~250k-token
  window have compacted mid-review (jstoup111/ai-conductor#2377: peaks of 236k–251k, with the
  reviewer's own reads accounting for 0.85–1.5M characters of output). Treat the window as a budget:
  - Do NOT re-read `HARNESS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or this skill file. They are already in context via
    the session-start hook and the skill loader.
  - Read each artifact once. The plan and stories are large; extract the task table, `Done when`
    blocks, and the criteria you are grading, not the whole file twice.
  - Bound every git and search command: `git diff --stat <base>...HEAD` first, then per-file
    `git diff <base>...HEAD -- <path>` with DEFAULT context (never `--unified=80` or higher);
    `git log --oneline -n 30`; `rg -l` / `rg --files` piped through a slug or path filter before
    listing. Never dump an unfiltered file list or an unbounded log.
  - Read source by symbol or line range (`nl -ba <file> | sed -n 'A,Bp'`), not whole engine files.
  - If you must choose, spend the budget on the shipped source under review, not on policy prose.
- **Delegated evidence gathering.** The window that matters is the reviewer's own: it holds the
  verdict. Keep it for judgement and push the reading into subagents through the host's facility
  (Claude Code: the Agent tool; Codex: `collaboration.spawn_agent` / `collaboration.wait_agent`),
  the same way §"Provider-native delegation" already allows:
  - One subagent per enabled check cluster: the APPROVED-ADR set (one per ADR when several apply),
    the diagram set, the changed-primitive reachability sweep (split by module when the diff is
    wide), and the plan-gap check against the sealed stories.
  - Each subagent returns a **digest**, not a transcript: the governing clause quoted verbatim with
    its path, the shipped code quoted verbatim with `file:line`, the caller chain for
    reachability, and a candidate disposition with confidence. Cap a digest at roughly two thousand
    words; anything larger is the subagent forwarding its reads instead of doing them.
  - The reviewer grades from the digests, re-reads only the lines it needs to settle a disagreement,
    and owns every verdict. A subagent never writes the report, the verdict, or an ADR.
  - **Model tiers.** The reviewer stays on this skill's pinned tier; do not trade it down to pay for
    fan-out. Reading and extraction subagents run on the host's mid tier
    (Claude Code `model="sonnet"`; Codex uses its configured default). Step a subagent up to the reviewer's
    tier only when its task is adjudication — an adversarial re-check of one candidate BLOCKED
    finding before it is recorded.
  - Subagents inherit the context budget above. A subagent that cannot finish within it reports
    what it covered and what it did not; the reviewer records the uncovered surface as unverified
    rather than silently passing it.
- **Validator discipline (MUST — copy verbatim into every subagent brief).** Both rules below are
  operator rules on the reviewer and on every subagent it delegates to. Include them **verbatim** in
  each subagent brief; a subagent that never received them is not bound by them.
  1. **Read-only evidence.** The validator and every subagent it delegates to MUST NOT execute
     tests, typecheck, lint, build, the integrity script, or any command that runs project code —
     including `vitest`, `npm test`/`npm run`, `npx`, `node -e` probes over project modules, and
     bash test scripts. Evidence is what the source and committed artifacts say: `file:line`, test
     names read from test source, `git diff`/`git log` output, and `Scope:` trailers. Reachability
     is proved by citing the caller chain in the source, never by running it. If a check cannot be
     judged without running code, grade it from the evidence available and say so in the rationale;
     never run it. The only files the validator writes are its own outputs —
     `.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md` and its review-required markers. Nothing else is
     written, staged, or committed.
  2. **Never yield with delegated work outstanding.** The validator MUST NOT end its turn while any
     subagent it spawned has not returned. Collect every digest before grading; if a subagent is
     slow, wait for it — do not summarize partial results and do not report progress in place of a
     verdict.
  - **Why.** Both rules exist to prevent a daemon halt class. Running project code from a validator
    mutates the worktree the SHIP gates fingerprint; and ending the turn with subagents outstanding
    ends the session in print mode, so the host's background-wait ceiling kills the pending
    subagents, no verdict artifact is written, and the engine's freshness handshake HALTs the
    feature (`post-dispatch verdict write handshake failed ... is stale`).
- Do NOT re-run §2/§3/§5 (feasibility/complexity/domain pre-checks) — those belong to the DECIDE
  pass. This is a code-vs-approved-design pattern match plus the reachability sweep above,
  deliberately cheap.

**Verdict:**
- **APPROVED** — shipped code matches the approved architecture. Proceed to finish.
- **APPROVED WITH DRIFT NOTES** — minor, non-violating drift (e.g. a diagram is now slightly stale,
  a pattern was extended consistently). Record the drift; proceed. Note it for a follow-up ADR only
  when it makes or changes a structural decision; otherwise no ADR is needed, and it does not block.
- **PLAN_GAP** — the shipped code faithfully implements the approved design, but the design is the
  limit preventing an outcome the sealed story criteria require. Include `Outcome delivered: yes`
  when the sealed story criteria are satisfied; record the outcome-level gap and proceed. Include
  `Outcome delivered: no` only when a sealed story criterion is genuinely unmet and the approved
  design is the limit; the loop HALTS for a human. Never turn this finding into unplanned BUILD work.
- **BLOCKED** — an enabled check found an architectural violation, such as an APPROVED-ADR
  violation or an unreachable production rung. The loop HALTS. A human must resolve it: fix the
  code to comply, or for an ADR violation supersede the ADR with a new, human-APPROVED ADR
  (`Supersedes: <old>`, old → `Status: SUPERSEDED`). **Never silently downgrade** an APPROVED ADR
  or auto-resolve the violation. After resolution, re-run the as-built gate.

**Artifact:** write the result to `.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md`
(run evidence — gitignored, stable filename, overwritten each run; NOT a
committed design artifact. Durable ADRs and the design-time architecture
review remain in `.docs/decisions/`):

# As-Built Architecture Review: <Feature Name>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Mode:** as-built (SHIP compliance gate)
**APPROVED ADRs checked:** [list]
**Applied check policy:** [each check: on/off — reason]
Verdict: APPROVED | APPROVED WITH DRIFT NOTES | PLAN_GAP | BLOCKED
Outcome delivered: <yes or no; required for PLAN_GAP>

## Production Reachability (every new/changed primitive → its production caller, file:line;
same-file exceptions independently cite root → caller → export at the reviewed HEAD;
UNEXERCISED entries carry their observation signature)
## Drift Notes (if any)
## Recorded Findings (if PLAN_GAP — affected outcome and why the approved design is the limit)
## Blocking Findings (required exactly when Verdict is BLOCKED)
| Finding | Class | Governing clause | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| AB-1 | REMEDIABLE | adr-2026-06-29-rate-limit-strategy decision 4 | <one-line finding summary> |
| AB-2 | REMEDIABLE | Task 7 | <one-line finding summary> |
## Blocking Violations (if BLOCKED — which APPROVED ADR or unreachable rung, file:line)
## Resolution (if BLOCKED — code fix OR superseding ADR; human-approved)
```

For a `BLOCKED` verdict, `## Blocking Findings` is required exactly once and contains one row per
finding. The header row is **copy-exact** — write literally
`| Finding | Class | Governing clause | Summary |` with those four names in that order. Do not
rename columns (`ID`, `Description`, `Finding` in the last slot, etc.): the SHIP gate parses this
table mechanically and any other header halts the feature as unparseable, wasting the whole review
lap. `Class` is a closed set: exactly `REMEDIABLE` or `DESIGN`. A `REMEDIABLE` row's
`Governing clause` must name either an ADR filename stem plus its decision number (`adr-x decision 3`
or the heading shorthand `adr-x D3` — both resolve), or a task id from
this feature's own plan; a REMEDIABLE row without a governing clause is malformed. Write the clause
as **bare text** — no backticks, no bold — and cite **exactly one** clause per row: the resolver
matches a single identifier, so `` `adr-x` + Decision 4 `` and `Task 9 and Task 10` are both
unresolvable and HALT the bounded remediation route. Split a finding that spans two tasks into two
rows. `DESIGN` is for a
finding that requires a human architectural decision rather than work already required by an approved
artifact.

The conductor's objective gate reads the `Verdict:` line and is **fail-closed**: only an explicit
`APPROVED` or `APPROVED WITH DRIFT NOTES` passes. A `PLAN_GAP` passes only with
`Outcome delivered: yes`; with `Outcome delivered: no` it HALTs for a human. `BLOCKED`, a missing
`Verdict:` line, or any malformed verdict keeps the gate unsatisfied so the SHIP tail cannot reach
finish — always write a clean, recognizable verdict.

**Review marker:** review mode for this step is **conditional**. Write
`.pipeline/review-required-architecture-as-built` (existence = signal) whenever the verdict is not a
clean `APPROVED` — i.e. on `APPROVED WITH DRIFT NOTES`, `PLAN_GAP`, or `BLOCKED`, or when an ADR
was superseded to resolve a violation. On a clean `APPROVED`, do NOT write the marker.

```bash
# Example: write the marker when the as-built sweep was not clean
mkdir -p .pipeline
echo "verdict: BLOCKED, violated adr-2026-06-29-rate-limit-strategy" > .pipeline/review-required-architecture-as-built
```

## Verification

- [ ] All stories assessed for feasibility
- [ ] Complexity rated per story
- [ ] Alignment checked against .docs/decisions/ and CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Domain integrity pre-checked
- [ ] Risk register populated
- [ ] **Medium/Large tier:** `## Wiring Surface` section present, naming where each new
      production surface will be called from — BLOCKS approval if missing (not required
      for Small; design-time only, does not affect §12 as-built reachability sweep)
- [ ] ADR created only for each uncovered structural decision; existing governing ADRs cited and reused
- [ ] Review written to .docs/decisions/
- [ ] Verdict issued (APPROVED / CONDITIONS / BLOCKED)
- [ ] Architecture diagrams reviewed for accuracy against current implementation
- [ ] BLOCKED verdicts halt pipeline and require human resolution
- [ ] `.pipeline/review-required-architecture_review` marker written IF
      verdict ≠ clean APPROVED, or any ADR was drafted/superseded, or any
      High-impact risk was registered (skip only on truly clean APPROVED)
- [ ] **As-built mode:** at SHIP, each enabled check compares shipped code with its governing
      evidence only (no new design)
- [ ] **As-built mode:** runs for every feature; each enabled check follows the supplied policy and
      each disabled check records its reason
- [ ] **As-built mode:** every diff-introduced primitive cites a production caller (`file:line`)
      from a real entry point; no caller ⇒ BLOCKED as an unreachable rung
- [ ] **As-built mode:** a same-file caller counts only after independently verifying the exact
      current-source root-to-caller-to-export chain; own-module-only and stale BUILD-proof claims
      remain rejected
- [ ] **As-built mode:** statically-reachable-but-unobserved behavior recorded as `UNEXERCISED`
      with its greppable observation signature
- [ ] **As-built mode:** verdict written to `.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md`
- [ ] **As-built mode:** PLAN_GAP records the affected outcome and `Outcome delivered: yes|no`,
      judged against the sealed `.docs/stories/` criteria and never against superseded
      `.docs/intake/` capture; no as-built finding sends unplanned work back to BUILD
- [ ] **As-built mode:** BLOCKED on any enabled APPROVED-ADR violation; resolved by code fix or
      human-approved superseding ADR (never silent downgrade)
- [ ] **As-built mode:** every BLOCKED verdict contains exactly one `## Blocking Findings` table
      whose header row is literally `| Finding | Class | Governing clause | Summary |` (no renamed
      columns such as `ID`); Class is exactly `REMEDIABLE` or `DESIGN`
- [ ] **As-built mode:** every REMEDIABLE blocking finding cites its governing ADR filename stem
      plus decision number, or its task id from this feature's plan; a missing clause is malformed
- [ ] **As-built mode:** every `Governing clause` cell is bare text (no backticks or bold) naming
      exactly one clause
- [ ] **As-built mode:** `.pipeline/review-required-architecture-as-built` marker written when the
      verdict is not a clean APPROVED
