## Purpose

Authors `.docs/coherence/<plan-stem>.md`: a single committed artifact mapping every
intake outcome bullet, every PRD FR (product track), every non-deleted ADR file in the
current spec change set when the coherence gate engages, every story,
and every plan task to its counterpart ids with a per-row verdict. This artifact is the auditable
traceability record the operator (and the land-time coherence validator) reads instead
of trusting self-reported "everything's covered" prose in a spec PR.

Any current-change-set `.docs/decisions/adr-*` path, including a deletion, engages the ADR
layer. That engagement is distinct from the ADR row pool: deleted ADRs produce no row, so a
deletion-only change has no ADR row to author.

**Correctness gate:** a row's verdict (`covered` / `gap` / `fail`) is a judgment call, not
a mechanical grep. Coverage, consistency, and achievability are separate questions: a counterpart
can exist and still contradict what it implements (§4d), or be compatible with a criterion without
delivering it (§4g). Per the `/verify-claims` protocol, ground every verdict in the actual
cited text — do not mark a row covered on the assumption that a plausible-looking
counterpart id exists; confirm it against the real artifact file.

## 1. Tier Rule (M/L only)

Read the spec's tier from `.docs/complexity/`.

- **Tier S:** this skill does NOT run. Skip it entirely — same treatment as
  architecture-diagram/architecture-review/conflict-check for S tier. No
  `.docs/coherence/` artifact is authored, and the land-time validator does not engage
  for S-tier specs (Story 13). Do not author a stub file "to be safe" — its mere
  presence is not required and produces work the S-tier exemption exists to avoid.
- **Tier M:** this skill runs, using the session's default model (no override).
- **Tier L:** this skill runs, pinned to opus for the dispatch (see Section 2).

## 2. Model Rule (M = session default, L = pinned opus)

This skill is tier-varying, the same pattern as `conflict-check` and `plan`:

- **M tier:** inherit whatever model the invoking session/step is already running —
  no pin.
- **L tier:** pin to **opus** for this dispatch. Large-tier specs have the widest
  fan-out of outcomes/FRs/stories/tasks and the highest cost of a missed transitive
  gap, so the semantic-judging pass needs the deepest reasoning tier.

The autonomous/daemon path resolves this via `DEFAULT_STEP_TIER_OVERRIDES.coherence_check.L`
in `resolved-config.ts` (wired in a later task); this SKILL.md documents the same rule
for interactive/phone-driven runs, where the operator's active session may not be opus
and must be told to escalate.

## 3. Inputs

Load, in order:

1. Staged/committed intake outcomes — `.pipeline/` staged outcomes file if present, or
   the committed `.docs/intake/<plan-stem>.md` marker if land has already run once.
   If neither exists (chat-origin idea), the outcome row class is not required.
2. The approved PRD (product track only) — `.docs/specs/<plan-stem>.md`, for its
   enumerated `FR-N` requirements.
3. The stories file — `.docs/stories/<plan-stem>.md`, for `**Requirement:**` and story
   ids.
4. The plan — `.docs/plans/<plan-stem>.md`, for `**Story:**` lines, task ids, the
   plan's own `## Coverage Check` table if present, and its `## Architecture Obligation
   Coverage` table when the changed ADR pool contains citable decisions.
5. The ADR files in the current spec change set — each non-deleted
   `.docs/decisions/adr-*.md` file. This is the row set when the coherence gate engages;
   do not expand it to every decision that conceptually constrains the stories.

## 4. Mapping-Artifact Format

Write `.docs/coherence/<plan-stem>.md`. The plan-stem in the filename MUST match the
plan's own filename stem exactly — the land validator rejects a stem mismatch as
missing-coherence-artifact even when a coherence file exists under a different name.

The artifact is a Markdown table (or one table per row class) with these columns:

| Row class | Cited id(s) | Counterpart id(s) | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### 4a. Row Classes (six)

1. **outcome** — one row per intake Desired-outcome bullet (skip this class entirely
   if no outcomes were staged/committed — an empty outcome layer is "not required,"
   never a gap). Cited id: `outcome-<n>` (1-based, in bullet order). Counterpart:
   the story id(s) that cover the bullet. The `Quote` cell must be the staged bullet
   itself — the sanitized projection under `.pipeline/intake-outcomes.md`, not the
   tracker's raw text and not a paraphrase. Only presentation is normalized away (a
   leading list marker, surrounding quotation marks, collapsed whitespace), so any
   other difference is an unmatched outcome
   (adr-2026-09-06-inbound-intake-trust-boundary D10).
2. **fr** — one row per enumerated PRD `FR-N` (product track only; skip this class on
   the technical track). Cited id: `fr-<N>`. Counterpart: the story id(s) whose
   `**Requirement:**` line cites that FR.
3. **story** — one row per story id declared in the stories file. Cited id:
   `story-<id>`. Counterpart: the task id(s) whose `**Story:**` line cites that story.
4. **task** — one row per task in the plan's task tree. Cited id: `task-<id>`.
   Counterpart: the story id it serves, OR — for `infrastructure`/`refactor`-typed
   tasks — a non-empty supporting-purpose statement from the task's `**Story:**` line
   in place of a story id.
5. **adr** — when the coherence gate engages, one row per non-deleted
   `.docs/decisions/adr-*.md` file in the current spec change set. Cited id:
   `adr-<stem>`. Counterpart: the story id(s) that implement or are constrained by the
   decision. Its verdict also covers the decision-by-decision plan mapping required by
   Section 4f; any incorrect mapping makes this ADR row `fail`.
6. **criterion** — one row per exact happy or negative Given/When/Then
   criterion extracted from the stories file. Its cells are the exact criterion
   text, cited task id(s), verdict, a verbatim quote from one cited task's
   `Done when` block, and a diff-locality disposition. The quote is matched as
   an exact substring after whitespace normalization; a paraphrase does not
   ground coverage. Do not quote Steps or Files prose: those describe work but
   do not require its completion, so they can ground a claim the builder is not
   obliged to satisfy. The disposition is exactly `diff-local` or
   `outside-diff`; only `diff-local` is non-negative and lands without a
   coherence waiver. A seventh optional correction cell is allowed only when
   the verdict is `fail`: use `plan`, or
   `architecture:adr-<stem>#D<n>` for a decision enumerated from a non-deleted
   ADR in the current change set. A corrected failure records a waivable
   `criterion:cannot-deliver-<layer>:<n>` gap; an unknown architecture decision
   also reports `criterion:correction-unknown-decision:<n>`. Do not use the
   correction cell on `covered` or `gap` rows.

### 4b. Verdict Vocabulary

Use exactly these three verdict values — this is the same vocabulary the land-time
validator parses and the same vocabulary the coherence-waiver mechanism consumes:

- **covered** — the cited id has ≥1 real counterpart id (confirmed to exist in the
  counterpart's own artifact file, not merely referenced) **and** nothing in that
  counterpart contradicts it (§4d); a criterion row must also establish achievability (§4g).
- **gap** — the cited id has zero counterparts, or its only counterpart is itself
  transitively uncovered (e.g. a story maps to a task, but that task cites no story
  back, or the coverage table claims a task id that does not exist in the task tree).
- **fail** — the cited id *has* a real counterpart, but the two **contradict** each
  other (§4d), or the cited task checks cannot deliver the criterion under the approved
  architecture (§4g). Coverage is satisfied here; consistency or achievability is not. Recording it as `gap`
  would misdescribe it and send the reader hunting for a missing artifact that is in
  fact present and wrong.

**The exact strings matter more than they look.** The land-time validator treats
`gap`, `missing`, `uncovered`, and `fail` as blocking for legacy rows, and **every other string as
affirmative**. Criterion rows instead reject any verdict outside `covered`, `gap`, and `fail`.
An invented verdict — "partial", "contradiction", "n/a", "pending" — can therefore
*silently pass the legacy gate* or make a criterion row malformed. That is why a
contradiction or achievability failure is recorded as `fail` rather than as a new word that reads more
precisely: `fail` is already in the blocking set and already flows into the gap list a
waiver can cite. A row that is genuinely not applicable (e.g. the FR row class on a
technical-track spec) is omitted entirely, never given a placeholder verdict.

### 4c. Gap-ID Scheme

Every **gap** row's Notes column MUST restate its gap id in one of these canonical
forms — this is the vocabulary a `.docs/coherence-waivers/<plan-stem>.md` waiver names
to be recognized (waivers are validated by a separate mechanism; this skill only needs
to emit the ids in the correct form so a later waiver can cite them):

For the `adr` row class, the cited id form and the canonical gap-id form are both
`adr-<stem>`, where `<stem>` is the ADR filename stem.

- `outcome-<n>` — unmapped or negative-verdict outcome bullet, or one whose row quotes
  something other than the staged sanitized bullet
- `fr-<N>` — FR cited by no story, or only by a story that itself maps to no task
- `story-<id>` — story cited by no task, or a story that does not tie out to the PRD
  (cites an `FR-N` the PRD never declares, or cites no FR at all — §4e)
- `task-<id>` — task with no valid story citation and no supporting-purpose exemption
- `adr-<stem>` — non-deleted ADR file in the current spec change set cited by no story,
  or only by a story that does not implement or honor the decision
- `claim-<row>` — the plan's own `## Coverage Check` table cites a phantom id or
  contradicts the parsed task tree (row number within that table)
- `criterion:quote-not-done-when:<n>` — a criterion quote occurs in the cited
  task body but not in any cited task's `Done when` block
- `duplicate:<ref>` — a second spec claiming an already-claimed `Source-Ref` (emitted
  by the land-time duplicate-claim scan, not authored here — documented for vocabulary
  completeness only)

Gap ids are opaque strings to downstream consumers (the validator, the waiver parser)
— do not paraphrase or abbreviate them; use the exact forms above so cross-checking
against the real artifact files (Section 5) is possible.

Before marking a criterion row `covered`, read every cited task's `Done when` block
and verify that the quoted text comes from one of those checks.

A **fail** row uses the same id form as its row class (`outcome-<n>`, `fr-<N>`,
`story-<id>`, `task-<id>`, `adr-<stem>`) — the id identifies *which* row, and the
verdict says what is wrong with it. For a contradiction, prefix its Notes with `CONTRADICTS:` and name the
counterpart id and the specific opposing text, so a reader can adjudicate without
re-deriving the finding.

Use `CANNOT-DELIVER:` for an achievability failure (§4g). Criterion rows have six required cells
and no Notes cell; a `fail` row may add the optional seventh correction cell described in §4a.
Keep the exact criterion text, task ids, verdict, verbatim `Done when` quote, and disposition
intact. Put the explanation in a prose paragraph directly below the table, naming the criterion,
cited task id, quoted check, and any binding ADR decision. Do not append commentary to the quote
or create another table for these notes. This prefix is explanatory prose, not a verdict,
disposition, gap id, or correction-layer routing signal. Do not invent an achievability-specific
gap-id form.

### 4d. Consistency Pass — Contradiction and Oscillation

Coverage and consistency are different questions, and this artifact is the only place
both are visible: it is the one view holding outcomes, FRs, ADRs, stories, and tasks at once.
A row where the counterpart exists but *opposes* what it implements is **`fail`**, not
`covered` — the mapping is complete and wrong.

After establishing coverage, re-read each covered row and ask whether the counterpart
opposes what it implements. Criterion achievability is a separate question (§4g). Two shapes matter:

**Static contradiction** — the two cannot both hold. An FR requires a field be
immutable after creation while a task adds an edit endpoint for it; an outcome demands
a gate fail closed while its task adds a bypass flag. Whichever is right, they cannot
both ship, and one artifact must be amended during DECIDE before BUILD begins.

**Oscillation** — the dangerous one, and the reason this pass exists. Two requirements
are individually satisfiable but mutually exclusive *in practice*, so satisfying one
re-breaks the other. Nothing looks wrong at authoring time; the damage appears later as
a gate kicking work back, the fix tripping a different gate, and that gate kicking it
back again. The loop does not terminate on its own, and each lap costs a full agent
session. Prefer catching this here, where the cost is an amended sentence.

Detection heuristic: for each pair of requirements touching the same behavior, entity,
field, or gate, ask **"if I fully satisfy A, does B still hold?"** Then ask it in the
other direction. Two "no" answers is an oscillation regardless of how reasonable each
requirement reads alone. Pairs worth checking first are the ones sharing a subject
across *different* layers — an outcome and a task, an FR and a story, an ADR and a story — because same-layer
contradictions are what `/conflict-check` already sweeps for, and cross-layer ones are
what nothing else sees.

Ground every `fail` in the specific opposing text from both artifacts, per the
verify-claims protocol in Section 5. "These feel like they might conflict" is not a
finding. If a suspected contradiction cannot be grounded in quoted text, surface it as
an assumption for the operator rather than recording a verdict either way.

**Preserved-behavior sweep.** For a criterion promising unchanged behavior, compatibility, or a
default-mode no-op, compare that scenario with every task check that introduces a side effect on the
same path, including logging, emitted events, writes, and dispatches. A new effect with no condition
excluding the preserved scenario can defeat the promise even when its own task serves a different
story. Name the exact protected observable and conflicting check; do not infer preservation merely
from a separate regression-test task. Use §5 if the artifacts do not establish that the paths overlap.

When a contradiction is confirmed, amend the artifact during this DECIDE pass — do not
defer it to BUILD. Follow the accepted-artifact amendment convention the sibling DECIDE
skills use: add a dated note beside the original assertion, additively, leaving the
original text in place.

### 4e. PRD ↔ Stories Tie-Out

The `fr` and `story` row classes are the two halves of one question: **do the PRD and the
stories tie out?** Both directions must hold, and they fail differently:

- **Forward (PRD → stories).** Every enumerated `FR-N` is cited by ≥1 story's
  `**Requirement:**` line, and ≥1 of those stories is itself covered by a plan task. An FR
  nothing implements is `gap` on its `fr` row (`fr-<N>`).
- **Reverse (stories → PRD).** Every story cites ≥1 `FR-N`, and every `FR-N` it cites is one
  the PRD actually declares. A story citing `FR-9` when the PRD stops at `FR-4` is a phantom
  requirement; a story citing no FR at all is untraced — it asserts behavior the product spec
  never asked for. Either is `gap` on that story's `story` row (`story-<id>`).

Both directions are **enforced mechanically by the land-time gate** over parsed ids — it
re-derives them from the real PRD and stories files regardless of what this artifact claims,
and reports every offending id, not the first. Do not spend judgement re-deriving set
membership by hand: read the ids, record the rows, and let the gate be the authority on
coverage. Reserve judgement for the part the gate cannot compute:

- **Does the story actually deliver the FR it cites?** A correct citation is not a correct
  implementation. An `FR-N` requiring an immutable field, cited by a story whose scenario
  edits that field, is `fail` (§4d) — coverage is satisfied, consistency is not. This is the
  reverse-direction contradiction the mechanical check cannot see, and it is the reason the
  `fr` and `story` rows carry verdicts at all rather than just id lists.
- **Is the citation load-bearing or decorative?** A story citing three FRs while its scenarios
  exercise one is not covered for the other two — record those FRs as `gap` on their own `fr`
  rows and say so in Notes, rather than crediting a citation the acceptance criteria do not
  honor.

**Boundary vs `/conflict-check`.** `/conflict-check` sweeps **story against story** — two
stories that cannot both hold. This section sweeps **story against the PRD** — a story that
does not tie out to, or contradicts, the requirement it claims to implement. A story pair that
conflicts with each other but each tie out cleanly to their FRs is `/conflict-check`'s finding,
not this one; a single story that no other story disagrees with but which contradicts its own
FR is this one's, and nothing else in DECIDE sees it. Do not re-report a conflict-check finding
here, and do not assume conflict-check's clean pass says anything about PRD agreement — it
never reads the PRD's FRs as a party to the comparison.

### 4f. Architecture-Decision ↔ Plan Tie-Out

For every citable decision in each non-deleted ADR in the current spec change set, independently judge
the plan's `## Architecture Obligation Coverage` row. A `task` disposition is `covered` only when the
cited task's `Done when:` semantically asserts the decision—not merely because the task id and quoted
text exist. An `existing` disposition is covered only with verified implementation evidence; a
`no-change` disposition is covered only when the decision genuinely imposes no implementation change on
this feature. If any decision mapping is semantically wrong, mark the parent `adr` row `fail` and identify
the decision id plus opposing evidence in Notes.

The land-time gate owns the mechanical checks: complete and unique decision ids, the closed disposition
vocabulary, real task citations, and exact Done-when evidence. Do not duplicate those string/set checks.
This skill owns the judgement the engine cannot compute: whether that real evidence actually fulfills the
architecture obligation.

### 4g. Achievability Pass

For every criterion row, ask: **given only what the cited task's `Done when` checks actually assert,
and the approved architecture that constrains it, would satisfying them produce the criterion's
Then-clause?** Related work and compatible wording do not establish delivery. When multiple tasks
are cited, judge their checks together; do not require each task to deliver the whole criterion
independently, or assume an unstated connection between them.

§4d asks whether the task **opposes** the criterion; §4g asks whether the task is **compatible with
the criterion and still does not reach it**. For the criterion "the gate rejects an unsigned
artifact," a task adding a bypass flag is a §4d failure. A task whose checks require only logging a
warning, allowing the unsigned artifact through, is a §4g failure: all its checks can pass without
rejection.

A cited task that cannot deliver the criterion is **`fail`**, not `covered` or `gap`. The counterpart
exists and coverage is satisfied; what is wrong is that its promised behavior does not work. Use the
existing verdict so the validator blocks it, and explain the failure with `CANNOT-DELIVER:` prose
below the table per §4c.

Apply these detection heuristics:

- **Mechanism-vs-restatement.** If the cited check merely paraphrases the Then-clause instead of
  naming the code path, state change, or check that produces it, achievability is unestablished: the
  task asserts the outcome without establishing how it delivers it. Surface this uncertainty per
  §5 rather than crediting it. A named mechanism still needs to yield the criterion; its name alone
  is not proof. Do not fill missing obligations from Steps prose or presumed BUILD work.
- **Constraint sweep.** Re-read the criterion against each approved ADR in the current change set.
  If the task could deliver it only by violating an approved decision, mark the criterion row `fail`.
  The explanation must name the `adr-<stem>`, decision id, and binding decision text. Preserve §4f's
  separate architecture-obligation judgement and its existing row pool.
- **Representable outcomes.** When the approved design uses a closed set of states, result values,
  or reasons, walk each required happy and negative scenario through the cited checks and identify
  the legal value that represents its actual outcome. Include required absence, skip, and no-change
  cases: reporting that an operation ran cannot deliver a criterion saying it did not run. A set
  whose permitted values cannot express a required outcome is `fail`, even if the producer and
  consumer agree on the same incomplete set. Quote the scenario and binding set; do not demand a
  distinct value per scenario when an existing value represents it truthfully, or invent scenarios
  outside the accepted criteria. Unspecified value meanings remain an assumption under §5.
- **Input-boundary proof.** If checks operate on a prepared input, normalized status, or exported
  subset, trace the required scenario to the check that produces that input from the actual source.
  A helper that correctly handles `invalid` does not establish that malformed source data becomes
  `invalid`; matching a registry to an exported subset does not establish that the subset includes
  everything the criterion quantifies over. Identify the decoding/validation or enumeration boundary
  and its owning task check. Consider required error exits too: a later reporter cannot supply a
  promised result if the planned earlier refusal never reaches it. Credit existing evidence and
  sibling tasks, and distinguish a demonstrated bypass (`fail`) from an unspecified connection (§5).

Ground each finding in the exact criterion and cited `Done when` text, with the binding ADR decision
where applicable. "This task feels thin" is not a finding. If the artifacts do not settle
achievability, surface the uncertainty as an assumption under §5: interactive runs wait for operator
confirmation; autonomous runs record `gap`. Never turn an unconfirmed assumption into a pass.

## 5. Semantic-Judging Instructions (verify-claims protocol)

Per `/verify-claims`, this skill is a **verifier/judge** role: it renders a verdict
per row and must never assert "covered" that it has not actually confirmed.

- **Calibrate claims.** Before marking a row covered, `Read`/`grep` the counterpart
  artifact file and confirm the cited id is real and the coverage is genuine (not just
  a plausible-sounding phrase match). Prefer the cheap read over an inferred guess
  every time it would settle the question.
- **Surface every assumption.** If a row's coverage is ambiguous (e.g. a story vaguely
  gestures at an outcome without an explicit citation), do not silently resolve it in
  either direction — surface it as an assumption with confidence, impact-if-wrong, and
  how to confirm, per the repository's correctness and assumption gate.
- **Hard-block on unconfirmed load-bearing assumptions.** A verdict on this artifact is
  load-bearing — it gates land. Never mark a row "covered" on an unconfirmed
  assumption about what a story or task "probably" means. Interactive runs: present
  the ambiguous row and wait for operator confirmation before finalizing the artifact.
  Autonomous/daemon runs: mark the row `gap` and let the fail-closed land gate surface
  it — never silently resolve ambiguity as a pass.
- **Fabricated citations are never coverage.** A cited counterpart id that does not
  exist in its source file is not "covered with a typo" — it is a gap, and the
  land-time validator independently cross-checks every cited id against the real
  artifact files regardless of what this skill wrote.

## 6. Output

1. Write `.docs/coherence/<plan-stem>.md` with the table(s) described in Section 4.
2. Ensure the file renders as valid Markdown (a real table, not fenced prose) — it
   must be readable directly in the spec PR diff (Story 2).
3. Do not stage or commit a coherence artifact for a technical-track spec's `fr` row
   class, a chat-origin spec's `outcome` row class, or an `adr` row class when the current
   spec change set has no non-deleted `.docs/decisions/adr-*.md` file — omission is
   correct there, not a gap. A deleted ADR path still engages the ADR layer, but it does
   not enter that row pool.
