## Purpose

Removal is a first-class change type. Its deliverable is the deletion itself and an intact
surviving suite, not a new test asserting that the removed thing is absent. Treat removal-shaped
work as a change to what remains: remove the obsolete file, seam, flag, symbol, or code path, and
preserve the behavior that survives it.

The evidence for a completed removal task is the deletion diff plus passing scoped survivor tests.
The engine-native `test_suite` step owns full surviving-suite proof.
Deletion does not create new behavior to prove, so do not manufacture an absence assertion to
make removal work look like an additive test cycle.

## Absence-Test Prohibition

At spec time, do not write a plan task or story criterion whose subject is that code, files, or
symbols no longer exist. Plans and stories describe the deletion and the observable behavior that
must survive it; they never prescribe an absence test or label one verify-only to force its
creation.

At build time, do not author a test whose subject is that removed code no longer exists. There is
no rubric exemption to lean on: APPROVED `adr-2026-08-22-one-owner-per-review-question.md` retires
the `scope`, `completeness`, and `rootCause` rubrics together with their exemptions — superseding
`adr-2026-08-12-removal-anchored-tautology-exemption.md` — and leaves `test-quality` as the only
shipped rubric. Removal task evidence is the deletion diff plus passing scoped survivor tests, not an
absence assertion. Aggregate proof belongs to the engine-native `test_suite` step.

## Survivor Method

First identify the survivors: enumerate the behavior that must keep working after the removal.
Write this survivor inventory when the survivors are non-obvious, including a shared seam or
behavior partially carried by the code being removed. Skip the inventory only when every survivor
is obvious and fully covered by existing tests.

Follow this order:

1. Write the required survivor inventory.
2. Check each survivor for existing coverage.
3. For every uncovered survivor, add and commit a characterization test before any deletion.
4. Delete the obsolete code.
5. Run the affected survivor tests through `ai-conductor scoped-run <selectors...>` and leave
   them green. If scope is uncertain, report it and defer aggregate proof to the engine-native
   `test_suite` step. Never run the full suite in the removal session.

Hard stop: do not proceed with deletion until each uncovered survivor has a characterization test.

## Test Triage

Classify every test that touches removed code before changing it:

- **DIRECT** — its sole subject is the removed behavior. Delete it in the same change.
- **INCIDENTAL** — it touches the removed code through shared fixtures, an integration flow, or an
  acceptance test for a surviving feature. Mutate it to exercise the surviving behavior; never
  delete it for the removal.

Acceptance tests are deleted only when they are DIRECT. An acceptance test that covers a surviving
feature is INCIDENTAL even if the removal requires changing its setup or assertions.

## Completeness Sweep

Before closing a removal task, sweep source, tests, config, and docs for literal removed symbol and
path names. Cover imports and other references, file paths, config keys, and documentation mentions.
Review every hit: remove it or explicitly justify it in the commit. An unresolved hit means the
removal task cannot close.

Grep variants can silently skip binary or NUL-bearing files, yielding empty output. Sweep literal
symbol and path names and review the hit list; empty output alone is not proof of absence.
