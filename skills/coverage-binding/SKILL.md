## Judgement policy

Each claim is judged independently against its cited task's `Done when` checks. For each claim,
answer this one question: does at least one cited check assert that claim's criterion? No claim's
verdict may be inferred from another claim.

Return `asserts` only when a cited check explicitly requires the criterion's behavior. Topical
adjacency, related implementation work, or a plausible inference is `does-not-assert` when the
check does not actually require that behavior.

Judge observable outcomes, not wording. A check that requires the same observable outcome with
equal or greater precision asserts it, even when phrased differently: "rejected naming the field"
asserts "the rejection names the field", and "byte-identical" asserts "equal". A check with lesser
precision does not: "deep-equal" does not assert "byte-identical". A criterion clause that only
restates the consequence of an asserted check's failure under an existing gate (for example "fails
before the change can land" when the check asserts the integrity suite fails) is asserted by that
check.
Every other outcome in the criterion, including absence and no-op outcomes, still needs a check
that requires it.

Do not read files, inspect a diff, use a transcript, or infer facts beyond the supplied pair.

## Result contract

Return exactly one JSON object and no surrounding prose:

```json
{ "verdicts": [ { "digest": "...", "verdict": "asserts" }, { "digest": "...", "verdict": "does-not-assert", "missingAssertion": "..." } ] }
```

Return one entry per supplied claim, keyed by the supplied `digest`. `verdict` is closed to `asserts`
or `does-not-assert`. Include a non-empty `missingAssertion` only with `does-not-assert`.
