## Purpose

The **technical implementation plan** (`HOW`) that `build` ships from — the bridge between the
behavioral stories (`WHAT`) and shipped code. Stories say *what* the system should do; the plan
decides *how*: the technical approach, which files change, the 2–5 min TDD tasks, and their
dependencies/sequencing. Any agent can execute it with zero additional context.

This is **not** a re-listing of the stories. It adds the engineering layer they don't carry:
architecture/approach, file-level changes, task ordering, and dependencies. Traceability runs
PRD `FR-N` → story → task. Every acceptance criterion maps to at least one task; negative-path
stories become explicit test tasks — not afterthoughts.

**Correctness gate:** a plan encodes technical assumptions (which files change, how a subsystem
behaves, what an API accepts). Apply the `/verify-claims` protocol before finalizing tasks —
prefer one cheap `Read`/`grep` over a guess, attach a grounded confidence % to claims you cannot
cheaply verify, and HARD-BLOCK (operator approval interactive, HALT if autonomous) on any
unconfirmed assumption that changes the technical approach or task breakdown.

Open with a short **Technical Approach** (a paragraph or few bullets: the design decisions,
key modules/files, and sequencing) before the task list, so `build` has the shape of the work
before the steps.

When the approach relies on a local implementation or test pattern, capture only the focused
context an implementer needs: the relevant traits, why they fit this work, allowed variation, and
search hints for finding comparable code or tests. This is semantic author guidance, not a new
header or parser contract. An implementation task affected by that pattern repeats its relevant
subset in its own steps, because isolated implementers do not receive the full plan. Do not anchor
the guidance to line numbers or snapshots. If the local pattern does not fit, or a departure would
change that task's approach, record the verified no-fit result or the authorized departure in that
task before BUILD begins.

Keep this focused pattern context distinct from the exact-copy declaration: use the existing paired
`**Pattern-source:**` and `**Rename-map:**` headers only when the plan replicates a source pattern,
and preserve their existing separate semantics and grammar.

Read the `Scope boundary:` from `.docs/track/<slug>.md` as binding; preserve the confirmed narrow/comprehensive breadth outcome; do not permit a materially broader expansion beyond it unless the operator confirms before it enters the artifact.

### Documentation boundary

Never create plan tasks, subtasks, requirements, verification items, or notes for writing or
updating ordinary project documentation—even when it accompanies functional work. Documentation-only
requests belong to `/explore`'s direct delivery route. Plans cover only functional behavior and its
implementation.

### Amending a sealed plan

The first BUILD entry seals DECIDE artifacts. If an operator approves a plan or architecture
amendment after that boundary, committing the amendment does not update the existing
`.pipeline/protected-artifact-seal.json`; the old baseline is intentionally retained until the
change is reviewed and audited.

Before clearing the resulting seal HALT or re-queueing the feature, review the exact protected
artifact diff and rotate the seal with the engine-owned reseal procedure in the stalled-feature
runbook. Record the approved paths and use an honest operator-review trigger. A pre-rebase seal
refusal is not a git conflict: do not invoke the rebase resolver or run `git rebase --continue`.

## Practices

### 1. Validate Preconditions

**GATE: Refuse to produce a plan without these artifacts:**

- [ ] Stories exist in `.docs/stories/` for the feature being planned
- [ ] Every task carries a `**Dependencies:**` line (use `none` when independent) or the plan
      includes a `## Task Dependency Graph` section — daemon discovery refuses merged specs
      whose plans lack a dependency tree
- [ ] Every story has both happy and negative paths
- [ ] Conflict-check has passed (check `.docs/conflicts/` for recent clean pass, or no blocking conflicts)

If preconditions are not met, state which are missing and suggest the appropriate skill.

### 2. Read All Stories

**Skip redundant exploration:** If exploration was already performed in this session (e.g.,
during explore), use the existing exploration results. Do not re-explore the same scope —
pass the summary to the Plan agent instead of dispatching new Explore agents.

Load every story for the feature from `.docs/stories/`. For each story, extract:
- All happy path acceptance criteria
- All negative path acceptance criteria
- Any dependencies between stories (shared entities, sequencing)

### 3. Generate Implementation Tasks

Break stories into tasks at **2-5 minute granularity**. Each task follows the TDD cycle:

For every story criterion, answer: “Can a commit outside this feature's diff
change whether this criterion is true?” Record `diff-local` only when the
answer is no; `outside-diff` requires a documented coherence waiver rather
than silently becoming a BUILD assertion.

Removal-shaped tasks follow `/code-removal`: specify the deletion, including what dies and which
observable behavior survives. Do not specify a test whose subject is the removed code's absence, or
mark a removal task `Verify-only:` merely to document that absence.

```markdown
### Task [N]: [Descriptive title]
**Story:** [Reference to story and specific acceptance criterion]
**Type:** happy-path | negative-path | infrastructure | refactor

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: [Specific test description with expected assertion]
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: [Specific implementation description]
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "[descriptive message]"

**Done when:**
- [Falsifiable check naming the mechanism and observable assertion — see 3c and 3d.]
- [Second falsifiable check; use 2-5 checks, each on one physical line.]

**Files likely touched:**
- [file path] — [what changes]

Write file paths **repo-relative** (e.g. `src/engine/foo.ts`, not
`foo.ts`): the build evidence gate corroborates each task's commits against these
paths. Basename/suffix forms are tolerated (matched at `/` boundaries, #425), but
repo-relative paths corroborate precisely and never collide.

**Verify-only:** [yes, or omit — see 3b below]

**Dependencies:** [Task N that must complete first, or "none"]
```

The `**Files:**` line is authoritative for the build evidence gate: each task's
commits are corroborated against exactly these paths (#424). Paths may be
plain text or backticked, `;`/`,` separated, on the line or as bullets under
it. `same` inherits the previous task's set, `same as Task N` inherits task
N's, and `none` means the task's commit trailer alone corroborates. Backticked
file names elsewhere in the task (Steps prose) are only used when no Files
line exists.

When a task is affected by local pattern context from Technical Approach, repeat the applicable
traits, rationale, allowed variation, and search hints in that task's Steps prose. Do not add a
new task header, parser grammar, line-number anchor, or snapshot reference for this context. Where
the task cannot follow the pattern and that changes its approach, its Steps must state either the
verified no-fit result or the authorized departure.

For test-owning tasks, map every covered acceptance criterion to a concrete, lowest-sufficient test
disposition: name the test layer and the assertion or existing coverage that proves it. Several
compatible criteria may be covered together by one focused test; do not prescribe a distinct test
per criterion, or a production-file change merely to create one. The task must still make clear
which criterion each disposition covers, including negative paths.

**Sealed-artifact prohibition:** A task MUST NOT name another feature's artifact under
`.docs/architecture/`, `.docs/decisions/`, `.docs/plans/`, `.docs/specs/`, or `.docs/stories/` in
any reference that directs an amendment. DECIDE performs any required amendment before this plan is
authored; BUILD must never receive that mutation as a task. A path naming this plan's own feature is
not prohibited.

### 3a. No Terminal Catch-All Validation Task

A plan MUST NOT end with a catch-all validation task whose purpose is to prove, validate, confirm,
or re-run the completed feature as a whole. Do not create a terminal "did everything work?",
"end-to-end proof", "full-flow validation", or similar task after the behavior-owning implementation
tasks. `/writing-system-tests` authors the story-level acceptance specs at BUILD entry, before
implementation; the native
`test-suite` gate, `/manual-test`, `/prd-audit`, and the as-built `/architecture-review` validate the
completed feature afterward.

Keep scoped RED/GREEN tests inside the implementation task that owns the behavior or wiring. A
behavior-specific integration task is valid only when it implements a named production integration
point, not when it merely exercises the already-completed feature or promises to repair unspecified
findings. Aggregate `test-suite` failures and `/manual-test` failures return directly to BUILD for
scoped repair. Blockers from `/prd-audit`, as-built `/architecture-review`, and `/finish` route
through `/remediate` to the appropriate SDLC step or the required human decision. Do not pre-create
a speculative "fix anything uncovered" task.

### 3b. `Verify-only:` Marker

A task block MAY include a `**Verify-only:** yes` line to declare that the task is
expected to prove existing behavior already satisfies its acceptance criteria, rather
than land new code. The match is exact (case-insensitive) on the literal value `yes`;
any other value, or the line's absence, means the task is NOT verify-only.

Use `**Verify-only:** yes` (or `**Type:** verification`) for a task that verifies or
documents behavior that may already exist. This marker is review-load-bearing evidence
for the Tautology and Completeness reviews. Never mark a task that delivers new or
changed behavior: over-marking widens the exemption and is forbidden.

Verify-only tasks preferably complete via an empty commit rather than a code commit:
carry a `Task: <id>` trailer and an `Evidence: skipped <reason>` trailer (see
`skills/tdd/SKILL.md`'s "Commit-less Completions: Evidence Trailers" section for the
exact commit form and the sibling `Evidence: satisfied-by <sha>` form). Do not force a
throwaway code change onto a task just to produce a corroborating commit when the task's
own acceptance criteria are already met.

**Authoring note:** `build_review` also runs a non-blocking, advisory per-task
work-happened floor that flags any plan task with no `Task:`-trailered commit as a "gap"
(warning only, never a HALT). If you're authoring a task you know will legitimately produce
no commit of its own, mark it `**Verify-only:** yes` here so the floor recognizes it and
doesn't flag it.

### 3c. `Done when:` — Falsifiable Completion Criteria (REQUIRED)

Every task carries a `**Done when:**` block of 2-5 enumerated checks. Together they are the task's
complete definition of done: when every check passes, the task is finished — full stop.

Each check must be **falsifiable**: a zero-context reviewer evaluates it to a definite yes or no
without appealing to an ideal. Name the test and what it asserts, the command and its expected
output, or the concrete diff property. "The guard is robust" is not a check; "the guard rejects the
three drift fixtures listed in Steps and exits non-zero" is.

Each check must be verifiable against a **named mechanism** — the function, file, gate, or state
transition whose existence or behavior it asserts. State what that mechanism does to produce the
mapped acceptance criterion's Then-clause; paraphrasing the Then-clause alone does not establish
delivery. For example: "the artifact admission gate returns a rejection for an unsigned artifact
before persistence, as asserted by the unsigned-artifact test." A test name alone is insufficient:
name the behavior it verifies. Existing mechanisms remain valid for `Verify-only:` tasks, and internal
tasks retain the lower-layer scope allowed by §3d.

For a preserved/default-mode behavior, make the relevant checks bound any new side effects on that
path to their intended conditions. For a closed result/state/reason set, ensure the checks can
represent each required scenario's actual outcome, including required absence or no-op cases. An
existing value may cover several scenarios when its meaning fits; do not invent extra states or
broaden the accepted criteria to fill a speculative case. Resolve any conflict with an approved
decision during DECIDE rather than leaving BUILD to widen the set or choose which promise wins.

When a check uses normalized inputs or an enumerated subset, name the owning check that establishes
how source data reaches that representation and how the enumeration covers the criterion's scope.
An invalid-input fixture or a self-consistent subset alone does not prove that boundary. Reuse a
sibling task's proof when it owns the boundary; do not add duplicate integration tasks.

Keep each `Done when:` bullet on one physical line. A wrapped continuation ends the parsed block,
so later checks can disappear from the land-time count and quoted evidence can lose its grounding.

**Unbounded quality words are banned unless immediately closed.** An outcome stated as
"fail-closed", "comprehensive", "robust", "hardened", "both directions", or any similar unbounded
property MUST be followed in the same block by either the closed enumeration of cases it means, or
the named mechanism that makes deeper failure impossible. An enforcement property is a mechanism
decision, and the mechanism is decided HERE, in DECIDE — never left for the builder to pick or a
reviewer to litigate. (Precedent: a task saying "extend the guard … both directions, fail-closed"
with no mechanism let the builder choose textual source extraction; review then correctly found a
deeper hole in it every lap until the cumulative cap halted the feature. The fix was a mechanism —
execute the parser instead of reading it — that DECIDE could have named up front. See #1763.)

**Review is bound by this block.** A completion judgement measures the task against its `Done
when:` checks. A genuine concern beyond them is new work: it is filed as intake, never raised as a
finding that blocks this task. Criteria that turn out to be wrong are amended in DECIDE, not
stretched in review.

Do not restate Steps or duplicate story acceptance criteria; the block states the observable end
state, not the route there. For a `Verify-only:` task the block names what the verification must
observe.

### 3d. Cross-Boundary Integration Ownership (REQUIRED WHEN APPLICABLE)

For each new or changed behavior that crosses a production boundary, assign exactly one task to own
the integration proof. That task's `Done when:` must state the observable behavior through an
appropriate project entry point: for example, a public API or route, CLI, job or worker, event
consumer, framework hook, application-service boundary, or the project's equivalent. A direct unit
test of a new helper proves the helper works; it does not prove the application reaches it.

This rule follows behavior, not file type. Do not force an entry-point test onto every task that
touches non-test code: an internal helper, type-only edit, or refactor can remain unit-scoped when a
sibling task owns the boundary integration. At Medium/Large tier, derive the owning tasks from the
approved architecture's `## Wiring Surface`; at Small tier, identify any changed production boundary
directly from the scoped behavior. Name stable observable behavior, not a `file:line` or private
caller that will drift under refactoring.

### 4. Task Ordering Rules

1. **Infrastructure first** — Database migrations, model definitions, route setup
2. **Happy paths before negative paths** — Build the working flow, then test failure modes
3. **Negative paths are explicit tasks** — Each negative path scenario gets its own task, not a "clean up error handling" catch-all
4. **Integration points identified** — Mark tasks where components connect for the first time
5. **Dependencies declared** — If Task 5 requires Task 3's model, say so. Declare only genuine
   dependencies and keep each task's `**Files likely touched:**` to the files it actually changes:
   BUILD schedules by ready frontier and fans out independent tasks concurrently, so a dependency
   that is merely narrative order, or a file set padded beyond the task's real reach, serializes
   work that could have been delivered in parallel

### 5. Plan Format

### `**Stories:**` Reference Forms

The `**Stories:**` line identifies the one stories artifact the plan covers. Use one of
these forms, each optionally followed by a human-readable trailing annotation:

```markdown
**Stories:** .docs/stories/<feature>.md
**Stories:** `.docs/stories/<feature>.md` (accepted stories)
**Stories:** [accepted stories](../stories/<feature>.md) — reviewed
```

The plain and inline-code forms name a repo-relative path. A Markdown link resolves its target
from the plan file; its target must resolve to the selected `.docs/stories/` artifact. Do not use
absolute paths, traversal outside the repository, a prose-only value, or a link to a different
stories file. Land and backlog discovery use the same resolution rule, so an invalid or unrelated
reference is refused before it can become a blocked merged spec.

### `**Pattern-source:**` and `**Rename-map:**` Header Forms

The `**Pattern-source:**` and `**Rename-map:**` lines together declare that this plan replicates
an existing source pattern. Use both lines or neither: a plan with only one line is malformed.
The Pattern-source accepts the same plain, inline-code, and Markdown link reference forms as
`**Stories:**`; the Rename-map accepts one or more ordered, comma-separated `source -> target`
pairs:

```markdown
**Pattern-source:** src/engine/source-pattern.ts
**Pattern-source:** `src/engine/source-pattern.ts` (source pattern)
**Pattern-source:** [source pattern](../../src/engine/source-pattern.ts) — reviewed

**Rename-map:** source-pattern -> plan-pattern-source
**Rename-map:** source-pattern -> plan-pattern-source, SourcePattern -> PlanPatternSource
```

The Pattern-source value must name a repo-relative path. The plain and inline-code forms use that
path directly; for a Markdown link, the link target is the path. Do not use an absolute path,
traversal outside the repository, an empty reference, or a prose-only value. Each Rename-map pair
must have a non-empty source and target around exactly one `->`; declaration order and case are
preserved. A malformed declaration fails closed rather than being treated as an absent pattern.

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Design:** [link to .docs/specs/ file]
**Stories:** [link to .docs/stories/ file]
**Conflict check:** Clean as of YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
[1-2 sentences: what this plan builds and how many tasks]

## Technical Approach
[The HOW, before the steps: key design decisions, the modules/files involved, data shapes,
and the sequencing rationale. A paragraph or a few bullets — enough that `build` understands
the shape of the work before reading individual tasks.]

## Prerequisites
- [Any setup, migrations, or dependencies that must exist before task 1]

## Tasks

### Task 1: [Title]
...

### Task 2: [Title]
...

## Task Dependency Graph
[Simple text diagram showing which tasks block which]

## Integration Points
- After Task [N]: [What can be tested end-to-end at this point]

## Architecture Obligation Coverage
[Required only when the current spec change set contains a non-deleted land-accepted ADR (`APPROVED`
or `SUPERSEDED`) with citable
decisions. Use the exact table contract from Section 7.]

## Verification
- [ ] All happy path criteria covered by at least one task
- [ ] All negative path criteria covered by at least one task
- [ ] No task exceeds 5 minutes of work
- [ ] Every task has a `Done when:` block of falsifiable checks; no unbounded quality word is left
      without its closed enumeration or named mechanism (3c)
- [ ] Dependencies are explicit and acyclic
```

### 5b. Task Header Format and ID Grammar

**Task ID Grammar:** Task ids can be:
- **Numeric:** `1`, `18`, `100` (legacy, still supported)
- **Dotted:** `1.2`, `2.1.3` (for subtask notation)
- **Alphanumeric with separators:** `task_1`, `rem-adr-001`, `task-name-02`
- **Characters allowed:** `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` (letters, digits, dots, underscores, hyphens)

Examples:
```markdown
### Task 1: Basic feature
### Task 1.2: Subtask of task 1
### Task rem-adr-001: Remediation for ADR-001
### Task task_setup_1: Project setup
```

**Trailer matching:** Commit trailers use the same id grammar for consistency:
```
Task: 1.2
Task: rem-adr-001
```

The parser and trailer matcher use identical grammar to ensure deterministic round-trip:
parse plan → extract ids → emit trailers → re-parse → identical ids.

### 6. Scope Sanity Check

After generating tasks, check the total count:

| Task Count | Action |
|---|---|
| 1-20 | Normal — proceed |
| 21-40 | Warning — surface to user: "This plan has N tasks (~X hours). Consider splitting into multiple features." |
| 41+ | Hard stop — refused when the spec is landed unless the plan carries an authorized scope exception. Break into separately plannable features and run the stories and plan steps for each. |

The only exception for a plan with 41 or more tasks is exactly one
`**Scope-exception:** <non-empty rationale>` declaration on one physical line in the plan. A
missing, empty, or duplicate declaration is rejected when the spec is landed; a valid rationale is
the recorded authorization for the oversized plan.

### 7. Coverage Check

**GATE: Every story acceptance criterion (happy AND negative) must map to at least one task.**

After generating the plan, cross-reference:
- For each acceptance criterion in `.docs/stories/`, find the task(s) that cover it
- If any criterion is uncovered, add a task
- Present the coverage mapping to the user

Record the mapping in a `## Coverage Check` table. At every tier, use one four-cell
criterion row per extracted criterion; Tier S is required to carry this table because
it has no coherence artifact carrier. The Criterion cell is the exact extracted text
(`Story <id> happy|negative: Given …, when …, then …`), not a paraphrase. The quote
must be taken from one cited task's `Done when` block, and the disposition is
`diff-local` unless a waiver is required.

| Criterion | Task id(s) | Done when quote | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Story 2 happy: Given …, when …, then … | 4 | "the required completion check" | diff-local |

**GATE: Every citable decision in each non-deleted land-accepted ADR (`APPROVED` or `SUPERSEDED`) in
the current spec change set must have exactly one row in `## Architecture Obligation Coverage`.** Use
this table:

```markdown
| Decision | Disposition | Task(s) | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| adr-<stem>#D<n> | task | task-<id>[, task-<id>] | <exact fragment from a cited task's Done-when block> |
| adr-<stem>#D<n> | existing | none | <specific existing implementation evidence> |
| adr-<stem>#D<n> | no-change | none | <why this decision imposes no implementation change> |
```

`task` is for implementation work and must cite real task ids plus an exact Done-when fragment.
`existing` is for a decision already satisfied by the codebase. `no-change` is for a constraint or
recorded choice that requires no implementation change in this feature. The latter two cite no task
and require concrete evidence; they are not escape hatches for undecided work.

The land-time coherence machinery enumerates the ADR decisions and rejects missing, duplicate, or
invented rows, invalid dispositions, nonexistent task ids, and task evidence absent from the cited
Done-when block. `/coherence-check` independently judges whether the cited task or existing/no-change
evidence actually satisfies the decision; deterministic validation establishes bookkeeping, not
semantic truth.

### 8. Save and Suggest

Save the plan to `.docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`

### 8a. Advisory Overlap Scan

Before the plan is committed, run `ai-conductor overlap-scan --files <comma-separated Files set>` over
the union of every task's `**Files:**` paths (add `--source-ref
<issue ref>` when the feature's originating issue/intake ref is known). Surface the
rendered report to the author as-is.

This check is **advisory only — it never blocks plan authoring.** Unmerged overlap
is a heads-up for sequencing/coordination, not a precondition; proceed to save the
plan regardless of what the scan reports.

### 8a2. Blocking Protected-Target Scan

Before committing the plan, run:

```bash
ai-conductor plan-protected-targets .docs/plans/<feature>.md
```

This check is **blocking**. It must report no task/path violations before the plan is saved or
committed. If it reports another feature's sealed artifact, perform the needed amendment in DECIDE
and rewrite the task; a `**Files:**` line does not resolve the violation. Do not waive the result or
defer the mutation to BUILD.

### 8b. Update Architecture Diagrams

After saving the plan, run `/architecture-diagram` in plan-update mode to update existing
diagrams in place with the planned changes. Diagrams are mutated directly — no separate
proposed-state files are created.

### 8c. Suggest Next Step

`/architecture-review` — the plan must pass architecture review before
any code is written. The full flow from here is:

```
/plan (you are here)
  → /architecture-diagram (generate/update current-state diagrams)
  → /architecture-review (feasibility, alignment, risks — consumes diagrams, may BLOCK)
  → /writing-system-tests (failing acceptance specs from stories)
  → /pipeline or /tdd (implement and verify affected tests; `test_suite` owns configured suite verification)
```

## Verification

- [ ] Preconditions validated (stories exist, both paths, conflict-check clean)
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion maps to at least one task
- [ ] Every citable decision in each non-deleted land-accepted ADR in the current change set has one
      mechanically valid Architecture Obligation Coverage row
- [ ] Every changed cross-boundary behavior has exactly one integration-owning task whose `Done
      when:` states observable behavior through an appropriate project entry point
- [ ] Negative paths are explicit tasks (not grouped into catch-alls)
- [ ] The plan has no terminal catch-all task that re-validates the completed feature
- [ ] Tasks are 2-5 minute granularity
- [ ] Each task has specific test and implementation descriptions
- [ ] Every `Done when:` check names a mechanism and its observable assertion, rather than merely
      restating the mapped criterion; each bullet occupies one physical line
- [ ] Dependencies are declared and acyclic
- [ ] `ai-conductor plan-protected-targets .docs/plans/<feature>.md` passes with no task/path
      violations; no task targets another feature's sealed artifact
- [ ] Plan saved to `.docs/plans/`
- [ ] Coverage mapping presented to user
