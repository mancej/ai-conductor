## Purpose

The **engineer** is the agent-hosted control plane for turning raw ideas into routed, approved
specifications — without ever building. It is the interactive front half of the Phase 9 flywheel:

```
operator idea ─▶ [ENGINEER: route → DECIDE → spec PR → nudge]      (this skill, interactive)
                          │ merged spec PR
                          ▼
                 [DAEMON: build the merged spec]                    (separate, independent loop)
```

**How it starts.** Inside a live supported host-agent session, the operator invokes this skill with
the host-native syntax: Claude Code uses `/engineer`; Codex uses `$engineer`. The existing
`conduct-ts engineer` terminal launcher is a **Claude-only launcher**: it opens an interactive
`claude /engineer` session. Native persistent-session launching and recovery for other hosts is
deferred to **#759**; do not imply that this legacy launcher creates a Codex session.

**Two independent loops.** This skill is the *idea→plan* loop. It does NOT build. The *execution*
loop is the per-repo daemon, which scans **merged** spec PRs and builds them. The only coupling is
the spec PR you merge plus a fire-and-forget `ensureRunning` nudge. The engineer never drives,
waits on, or owns the daemon.

**Why this is a host-agent skill and not a CLI REPL (ADR-008).** The loop must run your *real*
skills, agent personas, and hooks (`/explore`, `/prd`, `/stories`, `/plan` with their clarity loops).
Those exist only inside a live supported host-agent session. A Node REPL or a provider subprocess
cannot run them interactively — so the engineer **is** the host agent, calling deterministic `conduct-ts`
primitives for the mechanical parts (registry read, path-guarded commit, PR open, daemon nudge)
and running the DECIDE skills directly in chat for the reasoning parts.

## Boundaries

- **Never build, never merge.** The engineer opens spec PRs; the operator merges them; the daemon
  builds them. This skill MUST NOT run `/pipeline`, `/tdd`, `conduct` (build mode), or `gh pr merge`.
- **Route artifacts to the target repo, never the engineer's cwd.** Every artifact and the spec
  branch land inside the resolved target repo, enforced by `AuthoringGuard`.
- **Author in a per-idea worktree, never the primary checkout.** All authoring, `land`, and
  `handoff` happen inside `<target>/.worktrees/engineer-<slug>`; the target's primary working tree
  is never mutated. If the worktree can't be created, abort the idea — never fall back to the
  shared checkout.
- **One idea at a time, operator-gated at every fork** — routing target, create-on-no-fit, and the
  DECIDE step outputs all require explicit operator confirmation. Never assume.

## The Loop

**Handle exactly ONE idea per session, then end.** Do NOT loop over multiple ideas in-chat (that
bloats and degrades context). Durable state (registry, lessons, processed markers) is file-backed,
so the next fresh supported host-agent session picks up everything that matters. The existing
Claude-only launcher (`conduct-ts engineer`) relaunches Claude Code with clean context for the next
idea; native persistent-session launching for other hosts remains deferred to #759. For this one
idea:

### 1. Capture the idea
The idea can arrive from **three** sources — resolve them in this order:

1. **GitHub intake.** First run `conduct-ts engineer claim`. It dequeues the oldest pending intake
   idea and prints JSON. On `{ "kind": "claim", "text": "...", "sourceRef": "owner/repo#N" }`, use
   `text` as the idea and **carry `sourceRef`** — you'll pass it back in steps 3–5 so the originating
   issue gets commented + labelled. On `{ "kind": "claim", "empty": true }`, fall through.
   **The originating GitHub issue's assignees MUST remain unchanged throughout claim, land, handoff, verification, and cleanup; the engineer loop MUST NOT add, remove, or change assignees.**
2. **Launch argument / chat.** If the launch prompt already carried an idea (`conduct-ts engineer
   "<idea>"` or `--idea "<idea>"`), use it. Otherwise take the operator's raw idea from the chat.

Empty/whitespace from all three → re-prompt, do not proceed. There is **no `sourceRef`** for ideas
that came from the CLI arg or chat — omit `--source-ref` in steps 3–5 for those.

> The bare `conduct-ts engineer` launcher pre-polls GitHub issues before this session starts, so a
> `claim` here returns work captured at launch. You do not poll yourself — just claim.

**Hypothesis reframing for embedded solution content.** If the captured idea embeds solution content
(e.g., "Fix direction", "Design sketch", "Proposal", named seams/functions — template-shaped or not):

- Treat the sketch as the **filer's hypothesis**, not the requirement.
- Carry it into DECIDE and `/explore` **labeled explicitly as a candidate, not the chosen approach**.
- Frame the idea for routing and discovery by its **problem statement + desired outcomes**, not the sketch.

The target shape (Observed / Impact / Desired outcome / Hypotheses) and its quality bar are defined
by the `/intake` skill. This step *consumes* ideas already in the queue; when instead **filing** an
intake issue on the operator's behalf (`gh issue create`), author it with `/intake`.

**Pure-sketch case (no stated problem or outcomes).** If the idea is a design sketch with no stated
problem or outcomes:

- Do **not** spec the sketch verbatim as the requirement.
- Derive the WHAT (problem + outcomes) from the sketch or ask the operator to state it.
- Confirm the WHAT with the operator before proceeding to step 2 (routing).

### 2. Route to a target repo
Read the registry: `conduct-ts engineer projects` (JSON: `{name, path, description, tags}` per project).
Reason **in chat** about the best-fit project — this is your own judgment over the registry, not a
spawned `claude`. Present the proposed target and your rationale, then **confirm with the operator**.

- **Redirect:** if the operator names a different project, switch to it. The originally-proposed
  repo is left byte-for-byte untouched.
- **No fit:** offer to scaffold a new project (`conduct-ts create <path>`). On decline, drop the idea
  with zero side effects. On accept, create it, then continue with it as the target.

### 3. Create the per-idea worktree, then run the REAL DECIDE skills inside it
**Author in an isolated per-idea worktree — never the target's primary checkout.** First create it:

`conduct-ts engineer worktree --project <name> --idea "<idea>" [--source-ref <ref>] [--permit-inconclusive]` → prints JSON
`{ kind, engineerRunId, slug, branch, worktreePath, reconcile }`. For **intake-claimed ideas**, pass the `sourceRef`
carried from step 1 as `--source-ref <ref>` — the claim record it resolves lets a later `land`
auto-resolve the intake body without having to re-thread it by hand. `--source-ref` can be omitted
for chat/CLI ideas, which have no claim record. This creates a dedicated worktree at
`<target>/.worktrees/engineer-<slug>` checked out on a fresh `spec/<slug>` branch (based on the
repo's derived default branch), disjoint from the daemon's own worktrees. **`worktreePath` is your
working directory for all authoring, `land`, and `handoff`** for this idea. Use
`--permit-inconclusive` only after the operator explicitly accepts that read-only checks cannot prove
push authorization.

The command runs the machine readiness gate before authoring. It verifies the exact repository,
required tools, remote reachability and authentication, and GitHub posture without mutating the
remote. A read-only remote result may be explicitly permitted as `push_authorization_unproven`;
a blocked result stops before worktree creation and reports a stable code and remedy.

#### Authoritative run context

Parse the successful JSON before doing any authoring. Retain the exact returned `engineerRunId`,
`slug`, `branch`, and `worktreePath` as the authoritative run context. Do not infer or regenerate
these values from the idea, title, branch, or directory name.

- Use `engineerRunId` for every later lifecycle command in this run.
- Use `slug` verbatim as the feature and plan stem for every artifact family named below.
- Use `branch` for push and handoff. It may carry a collision suffix that cannot be reconstructed.
- Use `worktreePath` as the working directory for every authoring, lifecycle, land, and handoff
  command.

The engine has already recorded `run_started`, `routing_selected`, and `worktree_created` while
creating the worktree. Do not record those mechanical transitions again. On a resumed session only,
recover the same values from `<worktreePath>/.pipeline/engineer-run.json`; the durable marker is a
resume path, not permission to infer a replacement identity.

- **Strict abort (never fall back):** if the worktree cannot be created (e.g. a detached/unborn
  HEAD with no derivable default branch), the command exits non-zero and makes **zero** changes to
  the target's primary tree. Do **not** author in the primary checkout — surface the error and stop.
- **reconcile** reports how a leftover from a prior failed run was resolved (`created` / `reused` /
  `attached`); a **dirty** leftover is refused (recreate it). Report the decision to the operator.

#### Lifecycle reporting for no-hook hosts

A host with structured Engineer hooks keeps using those hooks for the transitions they actually
emit. A managed Codex or other host without equivalent hooks must use `engineer run-record` around
every applicable Engineer step. Never double-record a transition already emitted by a structured
hook.

Use these exact command shapes with the retained run id:

```text
conduct-ts engineer run-record --run-id <engineerRunId> --transition step_started --step <step> [--provider <provider>] [--model <model>]
conduct-ts engineer run-record --run-id <engineerRunId> --transition step_completed --step <step> --completion accepted_result
conduct-ts engineer run-record --run-id <engineerRunId> --transition step_completed --step <step> --completion artifact_validation --artifact-paths <comma-separated-paths>
conduct-ts engineer run-record --run-id <engineerRunId> --transition step_skipped --step <step> --reason "<bounded reason>"
conduct-ts engineer run-record --run-id <engineerRunId> --transition step_failed --step <step> --error "<established error>"
conduct-ts engineer run-record --run-id <engineerRunId> --transition step_retried --step <step> --reason "<bounded reason>"
```

For each step the workflow performs, record `step_started`, run the owning workflow and its human
acceptance loop, then record `step_completed`. Use `accepted_result` only when that owning workflow's
result was accepted. Use `artifact_validation` only after deterministic validation proves the
required artifact, and include its repo-relative path or paths. A tool return is never completion
evidence.

If track, tier, or workflow applicability omits a canonical step, record `step_skipped` directly
with the concrete bounded reason. If an attempted step has an established failure, record
`step_failed`. Before another attempt in this same run, record `step_retried`, then record the new
`step_started`. Do not mark a rejected result complete.

Use the existing canonical lifecycle names: `bootstrap`, `memory`, and `assess` only when this
Engineer session actually performs them; `explore`, `complexity`, `prd`, `architecture_diagram`,
`architecture_review`, `stories`, `conflict_check`, `plan`, and `coherence_check` for the workflow
below. Do not fabricate completion or skip events for a pre-DECIDE stage the session did not run.
For the tier and track skips below, record the explicit skip as soon as applicability is known.

Every lifecycle command is a gate. If one exits non-zero or does not return the expected lifecycle
JSON, stop authoring, preserve the worktree, and report the exact lifecycle error. Never continue
producing work whose progress the lifecycle store did not accept.

With **`worktreePath` as the working directory**, run the genuine skills **in canonical conduct
order**, honoring each skill's own clarity loops and human gates. The engineer owns the WHOLE
DECIDE phase — the daemon only builds — so produce the complete, build-ready artifact set (every
`.docs/` artifact is written **inside the worktree**, never the primary checkout):

1. `/explore` → Pass the **problem statement + desired outcomes** as primary framing; if an embedded
   hypothesis exists from step 1, pass it explicitly marked as "a candidate, not the chosen approach".
   Run discovery and confirm the **track** (product/technical) → `.docs/track/<slug>.md`. Ephemeral
   notes only (no `.docs/` design doc).
2. **Complexity assessment** → classify the feature **S / M / L** (same signals conduct uses:
   models, integrations, auth, state machines, story count). Write the tier to
   `.docs/complexity/<slug>.md` with a `Tier: <S|M|L>` line (plus rationale).
3. `/prd`       → an approved product-only PRD at `.docs/specs/<slug>.md` - **product track
   only; skip on technical** (acceptance criteria live in stories there).
4. `/architecture-diagram`  → `.docs/architecture/` — **skip for Small**
5. `/architecture-review`   → `.docs/decisions/` (review report + ADRs) — **skip for Small;
   lightweight for Medium; full for Large.** Every ADR must be **APPROVED** (no `Status: DRAFT`)
   before landing. Runs **before** stories. Preserve the established architecture and ADR naming
   contracts; these repository-scoped artifacts are not renamed to the feature stem.
6. `/stories`   → `.docs/stories/<slug>.md` (must end **Status: Accepted**)
7. `/conflict-check`        → `.docs/conflicts/<slug>.md` - **skip for Small**
8. `/plan`      → `.docs/plans/<slug>.md`
9. `/coherence-check` → the committed traceability mapping (outcomes → FRs → stories → tasks) in
   `.docs/coherence/<slug>.md` - **skip for Small; Medium and Large only.**

These produce **Status:Accepted** artifacts via your real harness (agents + hooks). Do NOT
hand-write stub stories, DRAFT artifacts, or shell out to `claude -p`. If the operator rejects a
step, loop within that skill until accepted or abandon the idea — never carry a DRAFT forward.

The returned `slug` is the exact filename stem. Do not shorten it or substitute a title chosen by a
skill. Before `land`, audit every applicable feature artifact against the retained value:
`.docs/specs/<slug>.md`, `.docs/stories/<slug>.md`, `.docs/plans/<slug>.md`,
`.docs/complexity/<slug>.md`, `.docs/conflicts/<slug>.md`, and `.docs/coherence/<slug>.md`. Do not
rename unrelated or pre-existing artifacts.

### 4. Land the already-authored spec — from within the worktree
`conduct-ts engineer land --project <name> --idea "<idea>" --worktree <worktreePath>` (the
`worktreePath` from step 3; append `--source-ref <ref>` when the idea came from GitHub intake — this
comments "Routed to `<repo>`" on the originating issue, commits a `.docs/intake/<slug>.md` marker
carrying `Source-Ref: <ref>` so the issue origin travels with the spec, and advances the intake
ledger; write-back is advisory and never blocks the land). This is a **deterministic primitive** — it
does NOT author; the real DECIDE skills in step 3 already wrote the artifacts into the worktree's
`.docs/`. `land`:
- operates **entirely inside `--worktree`** — it commits in place on the worktree's `spec/<slug>`
  branch and **never touches the target's primary working tree** (no `git checkout` there),
- asserts the `.docs/specs|stories|plans` artifacts (plus `.docs/complexity/` and, for a
  non-Small tier, `.docs/conflicts|architecture|decisions`) exist **inside** the worktree
  (`AuthoringGuard`) and are real — **rejects** a stub string, any `Status: DRAFT` artifact, empty
  content (C2 guard), a **DRAFT ADR**, a **tier/artifact mismatch** (tier ≠ S but architecture
  artifacts missing), or a **dirty worktree**,
- stages only `.docs` (no `add -A`) so the commit is strictly this idea's set — no cross-idea bleed.

On failure it leaves the worktree in place for inspection (**keep-on-failure**). It prints JSON
`{ slug, branch, repoPath }` — pass `branch` and the same `--worktree` to step 5.

If `land` refuses, show the exact deterministic reason and repair only the named artifact or gate
failure in the same `engineerRunId`, `slug`, `branch`, and `worktreePath`. When the refusal maps to
an authoring step, record its `step_failed`, `step_retried`, and next `step_started` transitions as
described above. Rerun `land` with the same retained path and identity after the focused repair.
Do not create a successor run or reserve a fresh slug for an in-place land refusal. Terminal
cancellation or failure and a later retry continue to use the existing successor-run contract.
`land` itself records deterministic refusal or reconciliation events; do not duplicate those
mechanical events with `run-record`.

### 5. Open the spec PR + nudge the daemon - retain the worktree for review
`conduct-ts engineer handoff --project <name> --branch <branch> --worktree <worktreePath>` (the
`branch` from step 4 and the same `worktreePath`; append `--source-ref <ref>` when the idea came from
GitHub intake — on a real PR this comments the PR URL on the originating issue, adds a non-closing
`Refs <ref>` to the spec PR body (links the issue without closing it; the daemon's implementation PR
is what closes it on merge), applies the `engineer:handled` label, and advances the ledger to `done`).
It runs `gh pr create` **from the worktree** (so the PR opens for `spec/<slug>`), opens a spec PR to
the target repo (no-remote → local-commit fallback), records the authored-ledger entry, and calls
`ensureRunning(repoPath)` fire-and-forget so that repo's daemon is alive to pick the spec up **after
you merge it**. On success it records the exact retained commit and bounded review deadline, then
**keeps the per-idea worktree registered and usable for review**. The daemon maintenance sweep retires
that exact worktree after PR merge, PR close, cancellation, or deadline expiry, and records logical
retirement before physical removal. A failed removal remains retryable cleanup debt. It never merges
and never builds.

### 6. Deliver, then end the session
The spec PR (or local-commit fallback) is the **final artifact**. Once step 5 reports it, tell the
operator plainly: **"✅ Spec delivered for `<slug>` → `<PR url / branch>`."** Then stop — do **not**
ask for another idea in this session. In a Claude Code session, add: **"Type `/quit` to process the
next idea in a fresh session."** The Claude-only launcher regains control when the operator quits
and relaunches Claude Code cleanly. In every other supported host, tell the operator to end or close the session
with that host's normal session control; native persistent-session launch/recovery
behavior is deferred to #759.

> **Claude Code only — why `/quit` and not automatic:** an interactive Claude Code session cannot
> terminate itself (slash commands are user-only). The operator's single `/quit` is the session
> boundary that guarantees the next idea starts with fresh context. Other supported hosts use their
> normal session-end control; this skill does not define a launcher or recovery contract for them.

## Non-negotiable gates

- No idea reaches a build without a **merged** spec PR — and only the operator merges.
- Zero `claude -p` / authoring subprocess; zero Node readline REPL substrate; routing is in-chat.
- Cross-repo isolation: authoring repo A never mutates repo B.
- **Per-idea worktree isolation:** author/land/handoff run inside the per-idea worktree; the
  target's primary tree is invariant (branch + cleanliness unchanged). Remove-on-success,
  keep-on-failure, strict-abort if it can't be created.
- **No spec lands with a DRAFT ADR** — all ADRs must be APPROVED before `land`.
- The **complexity tier is recorded** (`.docs/complexity/<plan-stem>.md`) and drives the daemon's
  BUILD-phase step skipping; a non-Small spec must carry conflict-check + architecture artifacts.

## Verification

- [ ] Idea captured from the right source (`claim` first; CLI arg / chat fallback) — `sourceRef` carried only for intake ideas
- [ ] Idea routed with explicit operator confirmation (redirect + no-fit + decline all handled)
- [ ] For intake ideas: `--source-ref` threaded into `worktree` (to resolve the claim record's body) + `land` + `handoff` so the originating issue is commented + labelled, the `.docs/intake/<slug>.md` marker is committed, and the spec PR is linked with `Refs <ref>` (the daemon adds `Closes <ref>` to the implementation PR, auto-closing the issue on merge)
- [ ] DECIDE ran the real skills in canonical order — `/explore` → complexity → `/prd` (product) →
      `/architecture-diagram` → `/architecture-review` → `/stories` → `/conflict-check` → `/plan` →
      `/coherence-check` (M/L only, skipped for S) (not stubs, not DRAFT, no `claude -p`)
- [ ] Complexity tier recorded at `.docs/complexity/<plan-stem>.md`; for Small, conflict-check + architecture were skipped
- [ ] All ADRs are APPROVED (no `Status: DRAFT`) before landing
- [ ] Authoring + `land` + `handoff` ran inside the per-idea worktree (`--worktree`); the target's
      primary tree was never checked out or dirtied
- [ ] Exact `engineerRunId`, `slug`, `branch`, and `worktreePath` retained from worktree JSON; no
      identity was inferred from the idea, title, branch, or directory
- [ ] No-hook host recorded every performed start and evidence-backed completion, every applicable
      skip, and every established failure/retry in the retained run; no mechanical worktree or land
      event was double-recorded
- [ ] Completion used only an accepted owning-workflow result or deterministic artifact validation;
      no tool return was treated as proof
- [ ] Every applicable feature artifact filename uses the exact returned `slug`, and the filename
      audit passed before `land`
- [ ] A lifecycle recording error stopped authoring with the worktree preserved and the exact error
      visible
- [ ] Worktree creation strict-aborted (no primary-tree mutation) if it could not be made
- [ ] All artifacts + the `spec/<slug>` branch landed inside the resolved target repo only
- [ ] Spec is discovery-build-ready: stories end `Status: Accepted` (no DRAFT) and the plan
      carries a task dependency tree (`**Dependencies:**` lines or a Task Dependency Graph) —
      discovery warn-skips merged specs missing either, permanently until fixed on main
- [ ] Spec branch pushed to origin BEFORE `handoff` (`git push -u origin spec/<slug>` from the
      worktree — `gh pr create` fails on an unpushed branch and handoff falls back to a
      local-commit result that opens no PR)
- [ ] Spec PR opened to the target repo; nothing built, nothing merged
- [ ] On success the per-idea worktree was retained for review with its exact commit and deadline; on
      failure it was kept for inspection; a recoverable land refusal was repaired in the same run and
      worktree
- [ ] `ensureRunning` nudged the target daemon fire-and-forget (no lifecycle ownership)
- [ ] Sibling repos left byte-for-byte unchanged
