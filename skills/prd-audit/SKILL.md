## Purpose

At SHIP, judge whether the implementation was built as the feature stories specify. The stories'
acceptance criteria are the authority. PRD functional requirements are intent context when a PRD
exists; the plan's stated outcome is also intent context. This is a finding-authority: report
grounded judgement and do not implement, amend DECIDE artifacts, append remediation tasks, or choose
the gate route. The engine owns those mechanical outcomes.

Each finding carries exactly one grade: `PASS | FIXABLE | PLAN_GAP | OVER_SCOPE`. Verdict Table
findings are keyed to active story criteria; no-owner OVER_SCOPE findings are keyed as `NC.<n>` in
their dedicated section below. The engine rejects malformed rows with a diagnostic while retaining
valid sibling rows. Never invent a key (`OS.1`, `SCOPE.2`) or write duplicate rows for one key.

**Every Verdict Table key must be an id of an active story criterion.** Use the form
`S<story>.<criterion>`; do not use `NC.<n>` in the Verdict Table. A well-formed story key that
names no criterion in the active stories is also invalid.

`<story>` is the story's heading id verbatim, not just its digits — `## Story 5a:` owns `S5a.1`,
`S5a.2`, … and `## Story 2.1:` owns `S2.1.1`, `S2.1.2`, …, each distinct from Story 5's and Story
2's. `<criterion>` is always the numeric ordinal. Keys are matched case-insensitively.

Per the `/verify-claims` protocol, cite concrete `file:line` evidence and give a confidence when
evidence is ambiguous. Do not turn uncertainty into a PASS.

Run at SHIP alongside the other SHIP validators. The configured step decides whether it is enabled;
this skill does not infer a skip from feature tier, track, or the absence of a PRD.

## Inputs and authority

1. Resolve the feature's committed stories through the active plan's `**Stories:**` reference.
   Read every happy and negative criterion. If criteria cannot be read, report a BLOCKED audit that
   names the stories file; never pass by default.
2. Read the active plan, including its stated outcome and task ownership. Where a committed
   coherence mapping exists, use it to understand criterion-to-intent traceability.
3. Read the matching non-`SUPERSEDED-` PRD when present. Its FRs explain intent; they do not replace
   story criteria as the audit key. A PRD requirement without story coverage is a `PLAN_GAP` finding
   against that requirement's missing criterion/traceability, not a silently omitted FR.
4. Read the implementation, changed tests, and relevant BUILD `Scope:` trailers. Trace each
   criterion to concrete behavior or its absence.

Use focused context per criterion. A broad codebase search is warranted only when targeted evidence
cannot establish whether that criterion was delivered.

**Delegated evidence gathering.** This audit runs late in a long session, and the auditor's own
context is what holds the verdict table. Push the reading into subagents through the host's
facility (Claude Code: the Agent tool; Codex: `collaboration.spawn_agent` / `collaboration.wait_agent`)
and keep the auditor's window for grading:

- One subagent per story (or per criterion cluster when a story is large). Each receives the
  story's criteria verbatim, the owning plan tasks, and the changed-file list, and returns a
  **digest**: per criterion, the evidence found (`file:line`, the test name, or the `Scope:`
  trailer), a candidate grade, and one sentence of rationale. Cap a digest at roughly two thousand
  words.
- The auditor never re-reads what a digest already quotes. It grades from the digests, re-opens
  only the lines needed to settle a disagreement, and owns every row of the Verdict Table.
- **Model tiers.** The auditor stays on this skill's pinned tier. Reading and extraction subagents
  run on the host's mid tier (Claude Code `model="sonnet"`; Codex uses its configured default).
  Step a subagent up to the auditor's tier only for adjudication of one contested criterion.
- Bound every read the subagents and the auditor make: read each artifact once; per-file
  `git diff <base>...HEAD -- <path>` with default context, never `--unified=80` or wider;
  `git log --oneline -n 30`; filter `rg` output by path before listing. Do not re-read
  `HARNESS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or this skill; they are already in context.

## Validator discipline (MUST — copy verbatim into every subagent brief)

Both rules below are operator rules on the auditor and on every subagent it delegates to. Include
them **verbatim** in each subagent brief; a subagent that never received them is not bound by them.

1. **Read-only evidence.** The validator and every subagent it delegates to MUST NOT execute tests,
   typecheck, lint, build, the integrity script, or any command that runs project code — including
   `vitest`, `npm test`/`npm run`, `npx`, `node -e` probes over project modules, and bash test
   scripts. Evidence is what the source and committed artifacts say: `file:line`, test names read
   from test source, `git diff`/`git log` output, and `Scope:` trailers. If a criterion cannot be
   judged without running code, grade it from the evidence available and say so in the rationale;
   never run it. The only files the validator writes are its own outputs — `.pipeline/prd-audit.md`
   and `.pipeline/accepted-widenings.json`. Nothing else is written, staged, or committed.
2. **Never yield with delegated work outstanding.** The validator MUST NOT end its turn while any
   subagent it spawned has not returned. Collect every digest before grading; if a subagent is slow,
   wait for it — do not summarize partial results and do not report progress in place of a verdict.

**Why.** Both rules exist to prevent a daemon halt class. Running project code from a validator
mutates the worktree the SHIP gates fingerprint; and ending the turn with subagents outstanding ends
the session in print mode, so the host's background-wait ceiling kills the pending subagents, no
verdict artifact is written, and the engine's freshness handshake HALTs the feature
(`post-dispatch verdict write handshake failed ... is stale`).

## Judge each criterion

For every story criterion, record one row.

- **PASS** — the shipped behavior satisfies the criterion. Cite the code and/or behavioral proof.
- **FIXABLE** — the criterion is unmet and an existing active-plan task owns the repair.
  **FIXABLE cites its owning plan task.** It also names the criterion it repairs; do not invent a
  task, and do not use this grade when the required work is outside the approved plan.
- **PLAN_GAP** — the criterion is unmet and no existing task owns its repair. Describe why the plan
  is insufficient. For a PRD requirement with no traced story criterion, make that missing coverage
  explicit as a PLAN_GAP rather than assessing the FR as though it were a criterion.
- **OVER_SCOPE** — shipped behavior goes beyond the planned implementation. Judge it against intent:
  PRD Goals/Non-Goals and In/Out Scope when available, otherwise the stories plus the plan outcome.
  State whether the widening is within intent, outside intent but not user-visible, or outside intent
  and user-visible. Include any `Scope:` trailer rationale and operator-reseal rationale in the
  evidence. A reseal rationale that does not justify the protected-artifact change is an OVER_SCOPE
  finding; a rationale that does justify it is evidence for no finding.
  **An unplanned change usually owns no story criterion.** Key the row to the criterion whose
  behavior the change actually affects when one exists. When none does, do not force it into the
  table or borrow an unrelated criterion's key. Report it under a `## Findings without an owning
  criterion` section below the table. Its first column is `Finding` and each row's first cell must
  be a unique `NC.<n>` key (for example, `NC.1`). `NC.<n>` keys belong only in this section, where
  every row must be `OVER_SCOPE`; do not use another grade. Give each no-owner finding exactly one
  row — duplicate `NC.<n>` keys are rejected. Include its judgement in Criterion detail as usual.
  **Reuse recorded wording for findings the operator has already decided.** Before authoring any
  no-owner row, read `.pipeline/accepted-widenings.json` (it survives re-dispatch; it may be
  absent). If a finding you are about to report describes the same widening as a recorded
  decision — same file, mechanism, and behavior, regardless of how that entry words it — copy that
  entry's `summary` into your Evidence cell **verbatim**: do not reword, re-anchor line numbers,
  append decision history, or otherwise improve it, and keep the entry's `NC.<n>` key when no
  other row claims it. The engine matches operator decisions to findings by summary text, so a
  reworded rendering of an already-decided finding discards the operator's decision and re-halts
  the feature on a question they already answered. Only a finding with no matching recorded entry
  gets freshly authored evidence.

Do not conflate grades: an unmet criterion with an existing owner is FIXABLE even if another
criterion is a PLAN_GAP. One row carries one grade.

## Report

Write `.pipeline/prd-audit.md` as current run evidence, overwriting the prior run. Declare whether a
PRD was present, name all intent sources, and use the criterion-grade Verdict Table as the routing
contract. Per-FR evidence may appear below the table, but never replaces the criterion rows.

```markdown
# PRD Audit: <Feature Name>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**PRD:** present
**Intent sources:** stories: .docs/stories/<feature>.md; PRD: .docs/specs/<feature>.md | none; plan outcome: <outcome>
**Overall:** PASS | BLOCKED

## Verdict Table

| Criterion | Grade | Plan task | PRD: | Intent relation | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S6.1 | PASS | — | FR-7 | — | src/engine/example.ts:42 — implements the criterion |
| S6.2 | FIXABLE | 4 | FR-7 | — | src/engine/example.ts:58 — missing guard |
| S6.3 | PLAN_GAP | — | FR-7 | — | No active task owns the missing behavior |
| S9.2 | OVER_SCOPE | — | FR-9 | outside-visible | src/engine/example.ts:77 — outside intent, user-visible |

## Findings without an owning criterion

| Finding | Grade | Intent relation | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NC.1 | OVER_SCOPE | outside-visible | src/engine/unplanned.ts:12 — outside intent, user-visible behavior |

## Criterion detail
### S6.2 — <criterion summary>
**Grade:** FIXABLE
**Confidence:** 95% (verified)
**Evidence:** `src/engine/example.ts:58` — <what it proves or lacks>
**Rationale:** <why this grade follows from the criterion, its intent context, and task ownership>
```

The Verdict Table needs one row for every readable story criterion. Any row may cite a task present
in the active plan; cite its bare task id with no annotation. When a criterion's evidence genuinely
spans several tasks, cite them as a comma-separated list (`12, 13`) rather than narrowing to one —
every id must still be declared by the active plan. Every FIXABLE row must cite its owning
plan task, and exactly one: its repair is appended under that single parent, so a multi-task FIXABLE
citation is rejected. Use `—` when there is no task. `PRD:` records the intent FR(s) when known and `none` when
there is no PRD. `Intent relation` is machine-readable:
every OVER_SCOPE row must use exactly one of `within`, `outside-harmless`, or `outside-visible`; use
`—` for other grades. Do not encode this relation in Evidence prose. If report evidence is malformed
or incomplete, surface it as BLOCKED rather than fabricating a grade.

For OVER_SCOPE rows, add the intent judgement and reseal rationale to the detail: which source was
consulted, whether the behavior is user-visible, and why any Scope/reseal rationale does or does not
justify the widening. Do not self-accept, halt, or otherwise route the finding; the engine applies
the policy to this evidence.

## Verification

- [ ] Active-plan stories loaded; each readable criterion has one Verdict Table row
- [ ] Stories treated as authority; PRD FRs and plan outcome recorded only as intent context
- [ ] `**PRD:** present | none` and the intent-sources line state what was available
- [ ] Each row has exactly one of PASS, FIXABLE, PLAN_GAP, or OVER_SCOPE
- [ ] Every FIXABLE row names its existing owning plan task and its criterion
- [ ] Unreadable criteria and PRD-to-story coverage gaps are surfaced, never silently passed
- [ ] Each finding cites `file:line` evidence and has calibrated confidence where ambiguous
- [ ] Every OVER_SCOPE row carries an `Intent relation` of `within`, `outside-harmless`, or `outside-visible`; detail judges intent, user visibility, Scope trailers, and reseal rationale
- [ ] Every Verdict Table key is an active story criterion id, each appearing on exactly one row; a finding owning no criterion is reported below the table as one unique `NC.<n>` OVER_SCOPE row, never keyed to an invented or unrelated id
- [ ] Every no-owner finding that matches a recorded entry in `.pipeline/accepted-widenings.json` carries that entry's `summary` verbatim as its Evidence cell (and its `NC.<n>` key where free), not a reworded rendering
- [ ] Report written to `.pipeline/prd-audit.md`; no implementation, plan mutation, or routing performed
