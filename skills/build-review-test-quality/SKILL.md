## Purpose

Judge the Test Quality concern for one engine-managed `build_review` rubric branch. This is a
judgement-only contract: the engine owns scope selection, evidence assembly, result validation,
finding identity, the stamped result envelope, and the outer gate verdict.

## Input projection (v3)

Use only the supplied projection version `v3`. Its closed input contains:

- the lap ID, snapshot digest, and top-level `contentDigest`;
- the in-scope changed tests: only changed tests with a current-feature-owned, resolvable `Covers:`
  binding introduced or updated after the review base, pointing to an approved
  story criterion, an active feature requirement (`FR-N`), or a task `Done when:` check, represented
  as immutable content-region references;
- the changed diff by reference (`changedFiles`: per-file path, change kind, and hunk ranges),
  anchored by `mergeBase` and `headSha`;
- the current code-valid `test_suite` PASS; and
- typed reverted-production preflight evidence, including its source identities, classification,
  scoped-run result, executed selectors, and bounded failure excerpt when applicable.
- any concrete fallback candidates in `testScope`, each with its engine-established candidate ID,
  pinned source region, and allowed Covers obligation references. Unchanged legacy bare markers
  are excluded before projection; their ordinals never gain authority from the active plan.

The session runs inside the feature worktree. The diff content is not embedded: read referenced
files and obtain any per-path diff with `git diff <mergeBase>..HEAD -- <path>` (or the merge-base
form with `git show <mergeBase>:<path>`). Those reads are part of this closed input. Do not infer
facts from a maker transcript, task-status narrative, prior review, or state outside this projection
and its referenced content.

## Judgement

For each in-scope changed test, judge whether its assertion actually distinguishes the behavior its
`Covers:` binding names. Raise `test-insensitive` only when the test has a concrete,
stub-passable assertion: it could pass while the changed behavior is absent or replaced with a
stub. Keep independent tests or behaviors as separate findings.

The reverted-production preflight is evidence, never a finding by itself. Report its optional
`counterfactualSensitivity` judgement using this closed vocabulary:

- `supports` means either an executed in-scope example fails on the reverted tree, or the reverted
  production causes the intended tests to fail during collection or load.
- `indeterminate` means an environment failure prevents the intended tests from bearing on behavior
  before that can be determined — for example, the #1915 database-auth or boot failures.
  It is neither sensitivity support nor a finding.
- `not-applicable` means the counterfactual evidence does not apply to a sensitivity judgement.

A `stayed-green` result is not automatically a concern: read the test and cite the concrete
stub-passable assertion before finding it insensitive. An infrastructure failure is not a finding;
do not invent evidence, downgrade it to a pass, or turn it into content criticism. Tests outside the
supplied in-scope set are not this rubric's concern.

## Result contract (v3)

Return exactly one provider payload JSON object with a required `findings` array, required
`scopeResolutions` array, and optional `counterfactualSensitivity` field. `scopeResolutions` has
exactly one source-grounded resolution for every supplied fallback candidate; it is `[]` when none
are supplied. Do not return `kind`, `rubric`, `contractVersion`, `lapId`, `snapshotDigest`, or
`verdict`: the engine stamps that `judged` envelope identity after validating this provider payload.
Return every independent finding; an empty array means no Test Quality concern was found. Each
provider payload has this shape:

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "concernKind": "test-insensitive",
      "confidence": 85,
      "summary": "string",
      "evidenceLocations": ["path:line"],
      "anchor": {
        "rubric": "testQuality",
        "locus": { "path": "string", "contentHash": "string", "display": "string" }
      }
    }
  ],
  "scopeResolutions": [
    {
      "candidateId": "string from the supplied candidate",
      "status": "resolved | out-of-scope | indeterminate",
      "sourceRegion": { "path": "string", "startLine": 1, "endLine": 1, "contentHash": "sha256:string", "display": "string" },
      "obligationReferences": ["string from the supplied candidate"],
      "associationReason": "non-empty source-grounded reasoning"
    }
  ],
  "counterfactualSensitivity": "supports | indeterminate | not-applicable"
}
```

Omit `counterfactualSensitivity` when no judgement is reported; when present, it must use exactly
one of those three values. `indeterminate` never supports a finding, and a `test-insensitive`
finding still requires its own concrete stub-passable assertion.

For each fallback candidate return exactly one of these complete forms:

The only disposition statuses are `resolved`, `out-of-scope`, or `indeterminate`.

- `resolved`: candidateId, its exact pinned sourceRegion, one or more applicable supplied
  obligationReferences, and a non-empty associationReason. A finding may anchor this resolved region.
- `out-of-scope`: candidateId and a non-empty exclusionReason. Do not invent a finding for it.
- `indeterminate`: candidateId and a non-empty missingEvidenceReason. Do not use a sibling source
  region, a foreign Covers reference, or free-text similarity as authority.

**Closed vocabulary:** `test-insensitive`.

**Reference grammar:** `anchor.locus` is a `content-region` reference.

- a `concernKind` field (never `kind`) carrying the concern kind, with the sole allowed member `test-insensitive`;
- a nested logical anchor — `{"rubric": "testQuality", "locus": {"path": "<repository-relative path>",
  "contentHash": "sha256:<normalized-test-title>", "display": "<human-readable non-coordinate label>",
  "occurrence": <0-based ordinal among equal-content regions in this path; omit when unique>}}`.
  `locus` is the immutable in-scope content-region reference. The anchor is never flattened to the
  finding's top level or rename it;
- an optional integer `confidence` from 0 through 100: the grader's calibrated confidence in this
  finding. Omit it only when no numeric calibration is available; an omitted confidence remains
  blocking. The engine may suppress a reported confidence below an operator-configured floor; and
- an actionable summary; and
- concrete evidence locations from the supplied projection.

For a resolved candidate, you may copy its supplied source-region path and contentHash into
`anchor.locus`, with a non-empty display. The engine translates that evidence reference to the
existing declared-title/occurrence identity only when the complete validated candidate set identifies
exactly one candidate at that source reference and it is resolved. Shared source hashes remain
ambiguous: use the canonical test reference in that case. Excluded, indeterminate, and foreign
regions never gain finding authority through this translation.

The engine validates anchors, canonicalizes identities, stamps the envelope, and decides the branch
and outer verdict. This skill reports candidate resolutions only from supplied frozen authority; it
does not read, write, or apply a disposition.

## Verification

- [ ] Every finding uses only `test-insensitive` and a nested `testQuality` content-region anchor.
- [ ] Every finding cites a concrete stub-passable assertion, not preflight classification alone.
- [ ] `counterfactualSensitivity`, when returned, is exactly `supports`, `indeterminate`, or
      `not-applicable`; `indeterminate` is neither sensitivity support nor a finding.
- [ ] `scopeResolutions` covers every supplied fallback candidate exactly once using `resolved`,
`out-of-scope`, or `indeterminate`; its allowed statuses are exactly `resolved`, `out-of-scope`, or
`indeterminate`; resolved entries repeat only pinned source and obligation evidence.
- [ ] `supports` is used only for an executed-example failure on reverted production or a
      reverted-production collection/load failure.
- [ ] Findings omit tests outside the supplied in-scope projection; candidate resolutions use only
      supplied frozen authority.
