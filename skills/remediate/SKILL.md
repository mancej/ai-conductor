## Purpose

Turns a **blocking gate into action**. When `build_review` fails, or when `prd-audit`,
`architecture-review --as-built`, or the `finish` verification reports SHIP gaps the daemon would
otherwise HALT on, this skill reasons over each blocking gap and decides *how the daemon should
proceed* — autonomously where it can, human-in-the-loop only where it must.

**Correctness gate:** a gap's disposition and its routing target rest on a claim about the gap's
nature. Per the `/verify-claims` protocol, ground that classification in the audit evidence with a
confidence %, and do not auto-route on an unverified assumption about what the gap is — when the
nature is genuinely uncertain (not just the fix), that low confidence is itself a signal to HALT
for a human rather than to guess a route.

The daemon should be autonomous. So the default is to **remediate**: translate each gap into
concrete, file-scoped work and route it back to the right SDLC step. A **HALT** is reserved for the
three cases a machine genuinely cannot close:

1. **architectural-clarity** — an architectural gap that needs a human *decision* (ambiguous trade-off,
   missing ADR, conflicting constraints), not just a code change.
2. **product-scope** — functionality the **initial design never accounted for** (a real product gap),
   which needs a human DECIDE amendment.
3. **unanswerable** — a stall-question that cannot be answered from committed artifacts alone and
   needs more evidence.

If a gap can be turned into concrete work, it is **not** a HALT. This skill plans only — it assigns
dispositions and writes tasks. It does **not** edit code, write tests, or amend the PRD; the step it
kicks back to does that.

**Run when `build_review` fails, or at SHIP when a prior audit BLOCKED — dispatched by the
conductor on the blocking path.**

## Engine-selected build_review case-v1 mode

Use this branch **only when this engine context is the engine-stamped `build_review` `case-v1`
context declaring `domain: "build_review"` and `mode: "case-v1"`**. It is one judgement by the
existing `remediate` skill, not a new skill or a second dispatch. Do not create a skill or dispatch
another agent. For every other context, including all SHIP and stall remediation, skip this section
and follow the legacy gap-plan instructions below unchanged.

### Supplied input — complete or stop

Judge only the frozen, byte-bounded projection supplied in the engine context. Its exact input fields
are:

- `domain`: `build_review`.
- `currentFindings`: every current operator-unresolved content finding, each with its rubric id,
  stable finding id, anchor, summary, and evidence locations.
- `priorCases`: all feature-local prior cases, each with outcome, source links, effect status, and
  resolution evidence.
- `planContract`: the active approved-plan contract that determines whether work is admitted.
- `taskStatus`: the engine-supplied task-status evidence.
- `effectPointers`: the engine-supplied prior effect and BUILD-attempt pointers.
- `suppressionHistory`: engine-owned sub-floor finding history. It is context only, never a
  current source and therefore receives no `sourceOutcomes` row.

All feature-local prior cases must be present or stop: never infer, truncate, or silently ignore
history. Every supplied current finding must receive exactly one source outcome. Use the supplied
stable identifiers and evidence to make semantic judgements; do not match summaries as identity.

Do not re-audit the source tree. Do not read sibling rubric prompts, inspect a different review
artifact, or seek additional repository evidence. The engine already selected the scope, excluded exact
operator-resolved findings, assembled all history, and bounded the input. If the supplied projection
cannot support a justified judgement, return the required schema with the most supportable
case-level disposition; do not substitute a legacy gap plan or invent missing evidence.

### Required additive artifact

Overwrite `.pipeline/remediation.json` with one JSON object using exactly these top-level keys:
`mode`, `domain`, `sourceOutcomes`, `cases`. Set `mode` to `"case-v1"` and `domain` to
`"build_review"`; do not add legacy `dispositions` or any other keys.

`sourceOutcomes` contains one exact row with `sourceId`, `outcome`, `caseRef` for every and only the
supplied `currentFindings` identifier. `outcome` is closed: `acted` | `deferred` | `rejected` | `merged` | `refuted`.
Each `caseRef` is a provider-local reference to one canonical row in `cases`; it is not a durable id.
Several source rows may reference one canonical case only when the judgement is that they are the same
repair case.

Each `cases` row has exactly `caseRef`, optional `existingCaseId`, `disposition`, `priority`,
`rationale`, `confidence`, `effect`; a `refute` row additionally carries `refutation`:

- `caseRef` is the provider-local reference used by source rows. `existingCaseId`, when supplied by
  the engine in `priorCases`, may bind that existing case only.
- `disposition` is closed: `act` | `defer` | `reject` | `refute`.
- `priority` is closed: `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low`.
- `rationale` is bounded, evidence-grounded prose explaining the judgement, and `confidence` is
  closed: `high` | `medium` | `low`.
- An `act` effect is exactly `{ "kind": "action", "route": "build", "tasks": [{ "title": "..." }] }`.
  It contains one or more concrete, ordered, file-scoped task titles.
- A `defer` effect is exactly `{ "kind": "deferral", "title": "...", "body": "...",
  "exclusionRationale": "..." }`. Its `exclusionRationale` explains why no current plan task admits
  the work.
- A `reject` effect is exactly `{ "kind": "none" }` and its rationale explains why the raw finding
  is non-actionable under the supplied rubric and plan contract.
- A `refute` row MUST bind an `existingCaseId` for an already attempted `act` case, use confidence
  `high`, and use either `{ "kind": "none" }` or a complete deferral effect. Its `refutation` is
  exactly `{ "claim": "...", "assertions": [...] }`; every assertion has `assertion`, a `refuted` or
  `upheld` verdict, and evidence entries containing only `path` and `excerpt`. Evidence proves current
  tree content: use no line numbers, hunks, commits, or SHAs. A case may be refuted once only; a later
  attempt to refute the same case is rejected for human review.

### Authority boundaries

The provider must not mint durable case ids or effect ids. The engine validates the complete graph.
The engine stamps durable ids, reconciles history, reserves and applies effects, publishes any work
order, charges the kickback, and derives the effective route.

Never omit, duplicate, or replace a supplied source outcome. A `merged` source is a trace outcome,
not a case disposition; it still names its canonical `caseRef`. Never assert or create operator
acceptance, and never treat an autonomous case outcome as accepted risk. Do not apply an effect,
file an intake issue, navigate BUILD, charge a budget, or mutate durable state. Do not append to the
approved plan. In this mode the only write is the schema-constrained `.pipeline/remediation.json`
artifact.

## Practices

### 1. Load Input

Read the blocking gaps or stall-question and their per-gap evidence from whichever trigger
dispatched this skill (the conductor's dispatch context names it):

**Gap-based inputs (prd-audit, architecture-review_as-built, finish failure, build_review trigger):**
- `.pipeline/prd-audit.md` — the per-FR verdict table + Per-FR Detail (verdict, gap-class,
  `file:line` evidence). Blocking rows are the `FR-N` rows that are `MISSING`/`PARTIAL`/`DIVERGED`
  and **not** `ACCEPTED`.
- `.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md` — present when the as-built compliance gate blocked
  (verdict `BLOCKED`, with the violated APPROVED ADR(s) and evidence).
- `.pipeline/test-failures.md` — present when the `finish` verification found real (non-flake)
  test failures: per failing file, the tests, one-line reasons, and finish's read on the cause.
  If finish left no artifact (older skill, or it crashed), fall back to running the failing part
  of the suite yourself to gather the evidence.
- `.pipeline/build-review.json` — present when the `build_review` trigger dispatches remediation
  after a FAIL verdict. Read its rubric findings and reasons as the per-gap evidence.

**Stall-question input (daemon mode only, build_stall trigger):**
- `.pipeline/build-stall-question.md` — present when the build step stalled with
  `halt-user-input-required` marker (ADR-2026-07-10). Contains a question posed by the build
  agent, not a gap list. The agent was unable to decide autonomously and needs human input or
  artifact-based inference to proceed. Examples: "Should this validation live in the controller
  or the model?", "The acceptance spec faked X, but the real setup needs Y — which is correct?".

Consider **only the blocking gaps or the stall question**. Each gap already carries
`file:line` evidence — use it; do not re-audit from scratch. A stall question should be
answered by reasoning over committed artifacts (plan, stories, ADRs, task-status) without
re-reading source files unless essential.

**Remediation context pointers:** When the dispatch context includes `plan contract:` or
`prior attempts:` pointers, read every referenced file before planning repairs. Treat the
referenced plan task's **Steps** as the governing contract for the repair; prior-attempt
artifacts supply earlier same-anchor context, not a replacement contract. When no pointers
appear, inspect `.docs/plans/` and `.pipeline/build-review/` directly before planning.

### 2. Dispatch `remediation-planner`

Dispatch the **`remediation-planner`** agent with the blocking gaps + their evidence. The agent
returns, per gap, a **disposition** and (for autonomous dispositions) concrete file-scoped **tasks**.
Keep context tight: feed the agent the blocking gaps and their evidence, not the whole codebase.

Pass each gap's **finding id exactly as the report writes it** — the `Finding` cell for an
as-built `## Blocking Findings` row (`AB-1`), the `FR-N` (or criterion) row id for `prd-audit`.
The engine matches the planner's returned ids against those parsed ids one-to-one and fails
closed on a mismatch, so a returned entry keyed by the governing ADR slug instead of the finding
id halts the run needs-human with an id-mismatch message that hides the disposition the planner
actually chose.

### 3. Disposition Decision

Each blocking gap or stall-question gets exactly one disposition. **HALT is reserved for
`architectural-clarity`, `product-scope`, and `unanswerable` stall-questions only** — every other
gap must be turned into concrete work:

| Disposition | When | Daemon effect |
|---|---|---|
| `build` | impl / test bug with clear evidence (the fix is obvious from the gap); **implementation/test/documentation drift that preserves the approved architecture**; OR **stall-question is answerable from committed artifacts** | inject the emitted tasks → kick to **build**; for stall-questions, answer lives in `rationale`, `tasks: []` |
| `existing-task` | a current `prd_audit` **FIXABLE** or as-built **REMEDIABLE** finding's remedy is admitted by an existing active-plan task's **Done when**; bind that disposition to the real active-plan task ID(s) | re-stage the bound task(s) → kick to **build**; no task is appended and no plan-growth allowance is spent. Never use it for a `build_stall` question or a finish failure. |
| `acceptance_specs` | the gap exists because acceptance coverage is missing or too weak to pin the behavior | kick to **acceptance_specs** (regenerate failing specs), then build |
| `architecture_review` | changing or clarifying **approved architecture** is required before the gap can be closed | kick to **architecture_review** |
| `plan` | functionality that **is in scope** but the plan simply omitted or missed (a planning omission, not an architecture or design decision) | In a daemon run, a `plan` disposition is a terminal needs-human HALT and never re-plans. |
| `halt` + `category: architectural-clarity` | an architectural gap that needs a human *decision* before any code can be right; OR **stall-question requires architectural judgement beyond the committed spec** | **HALT** for human |
| `halt` + `category: product-scope` | functionality the **initial design never covered**; OR **stall-question hinges on product-level decision not in the PRD** | **HALT** for human DECIDE |
| `halt` + `category: unanswerable` | **stall-question only:** the question is ambiguous or cannot be answered from committed artifacts alone; need more evidence | **HALT** — flag the question as unanswerable and preserve it verbatim |

Judgment rules:
- **Sealed-artifact amendments return to DECIDE.** When a gap requires amending another feature's
  artifact under `.docs/architecture/`, `.docs/decisions/`, `.docs/plans/`, `.docs/specs/`, or `.docs/stories/`, do
  not assign `build` or `acceptance_specs`. Route it to the owning DECIDE step through the existing
  operator gate and DECIDE kickback path; make no request, ledger, record, or new artifact to bypass
  that ownership.
- **Prefer autonomous.** If the daemon can produce concrete tasks that close the gap, it must — even
  for `DIVERGED`/ADR-drift gaps, as long as the *correct* fix is determinable from the evidence.
  The audit origin or finding id alone does not determine the route: an as-built architecture-review
  finding whose approved architecture remains applicable and authoritative routes to `build` when
  it is conforming implementation/test/documentation drift.
- **HALT is the exception, not the default.** Only the three categories above HALT. "I'm not sure
  how to fix it" is not a HALT category — if the gap is an impl bug you can describe as a task, it is
  `build`.
- A gap that is an `impl-gap` in the audit is almost always `build` (or `acceptance_specs` when the
  real miss is coverage).
- **Baseline-passing test gaps are `build`.** Positive example: a changed test that passes against
  the baseline and needs strengthening within an existing task's RED/GREEN steps is `build`, not a
  planning miss. Negative example: do not select `plan` merely because the existing test passed
  against the baseline.
- **RED-waiver obligation:** An `acceptance_specs` disposition may waive separate RED proof only
  for a remediation that must atomically repair both the acceptance spec and its implementation.
  The disposition must require a recorded declaration with a non-empty reason and attributable
  approval; the resulting completion is reported as waived, never as proven RED. Without that
  declaration, route the gap through the ordinary failing-spec RED path.
- **Finish test failures are almost always `build`.** Decide what the failure means first: a test
  that lags an **intentional contract change** made on this branch gets tasks that update the
  TEST to the new contract — never a task that weakens the production code to appease the old
  test. A test that reveals a real implementation bug gets impl-fix tasks. Reserve `halt` for a
  failure that evidences a genuine design ambiguity, not mere uncertainty about the fix.
- **Never task a regression — this applies to every trigger, not only finish failures.** A task that
  removes, replaces, rewrites, or relaxes existing code, tests, or assertions must name, in the task
  title or the disposition `rationale`, the completed plan task or story criterion whose delivered
  behavior and coverage survive the change. Removing a workaround does not license removing the
  assertion the workaround stood beside: unless the evidence shows the coverage is genuinely
  redundant, task the replacement in the SAME task as the removal. A remediation task that drops
  coverage a completed task already delivered is invalid — the next audit re-raises it and the lap
  is wasted.
- **A regression by omission counts too — edit one of a matched pair, name the other.** Not every
  regression is a removal. When a task changes an enumeration, registry, vocabulary, id list,
  grammar, or any value a second location duplicates or must agree with, the task must name that
  counterpart and bring it along in the same task — or state that both are being derived from one
  source so they cannot drift again. Prefer the single source when the evidence supports it: two
  lists that must agree are a defect waiting for the next lap, and the pair that silently diverges
  is invisible until something reads both.
- **Close the class, not the cited instance — this is what stops audit cycling.** A gap's evidence
  names where the auditor happened to look, never the extent of the defect. Before emitting a task,
  sweep for every other site with the same shape and name them all in the one task. Two forms
  recur: **a sibling site** — the same wrong predicate, missing guard, or stale literal at another
  `file:line` — and **what a removal orphans**, where deleting the cited code leaves its last
  caller, its now-unreferenced helper, or its fixtures behind. An unstated remainder is not out of
  scope, it is the next lap's finding: a task that repairs one site of a class buys one audit cycle
  and produces its own successor, which is how a converging feature still spends four cycles on the
  same FR.

  **The sweep is bounded by plan admission, and never widens the diff on its own authority.** A
  sibling site is included only when an existing plan task admits it — the same test the
  plan-coverage rule above applies before selecting `plan`. A sibling site that no plan task admits
  is named in the `rationale` as found-and-excluded, with the reason; it is never quietly fixed.
  Sweeping past that boundary trades an audit cycle for a review finding that the change is not
  authorized by the plan, which is the worse deal: an unauthorized addition can deadlock
  remediation, while an excluded sibling is at least recorded where the next reader can see it.
- **Sibling trigger routes remain unchanged.** A clear `prd-audit` impl-gap, an as-built architecture finding that preserves approved architecture, and a finish test failure each route `build`. A `build_stall` question answerable from committed artifacts routes `build`; a question needing architecture, product, or unanswerable judgment routes `halt`.
- An `intended-drift` is `halt: product-scope` **only** if it reflects unplanned product
  functionality; if it preserves approved architecture, it is `build`. Route to
  `architecture_review` only when the approved architecture itself must change or be clarified.
- **Keep omissions distinct from decisions.** An in-scope planning omission is a plan miss, not an
  architecture or design decision, so it routes to `plan`; it does not make `architecture_review`
  appropriate.
- **Check plan-task coverage before `plan`.** Before selecting `plan`, examine the approved plan's
  existing tasks. A gap whose remedy is admitted by an existing task is `build`; use `plan` only
  when no existing task admits the remedy.
- **Reject contradictory dispositions.** It is forbidden and invalid to select
  `architecture_review` when no architectural decision is needed; that architecture_review
  disposition is invalid. Route that clear conforming implementation/test/documentation work to
  `build` instead. Conversely, it
  is forbidden and invalid to select `build` when an unresolved or ambiguous architectural decision
  remains; that build disposition is invalid. Use `architecture_review` when approved architecture must change or be clarified, or
  `halt: architectural-clarity` when a human decision is required.

### 4. Output Contract

Write the plan to **`.pipeline/remediation.json`** (run evidence — gitignored, overwritten each run).
The conductor reads this file to route, so the shape is exact:

```json
{
  "dispositions": [
    {
      "id": "FR-10",
      "disposition": "build",
      "category": null,
      "rationale": "kids/[id].tsx:119 reads .data.attributes.name, but apiFetch normalizes to .data.name (api-client.ts:108); the cold-link test mock returns an un-normalized envelope that masks the runtime break.",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "rem-fr10-1",
          "title": "kids/[id].tsx:119 — read kidIdentityQuery.data?.data?.name (the normalized shape), not .attributes.name; realign KidDetailScreen-coldlink mock to the normalized envelope { data: { id, type, name, birthdate }, meta }",
          "status": "pending"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "FR-4",
      "disposition": "halt",
      "category": "product-scope",
      "rationale": "The PRD never specified multi-currency wallets; supporting them is new product scope, not a bug — needs a human DECIDE amendment.",
      "tasks": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Field rules:
- `id` — the blocking FR id (`FR-N`). For a `prd_audit` report row where `PRD: none`, use that row's report criterion exactly as `S<story>.<ordinal>` (e.g. `S5.1`); real `FR-N` rows remain `FR-N`. For an as-built finding, use the violated ADR id (its filename stem, e.g. `adr-2026-06-29-rate-limit-strategy`); for a finish test failure, `test:<failing file stem>` (e.g. `test:loop-intake`); for a `build_review` trigger gap, `build_review:<stem>` (e.g. `build_review:completeness`); for a stall-question, `stall:<slug>` where `<slug>` is a 1-3 word summary of the question topic (e.g. `stall:validation-layer`, `stall:acceptance-test-fidelity`).
- `disposition` — one of `build` | `existing-task` | `acceptance_specs` | `architecture_review` | `plan` | `publication` | `halt`.
  Use `existing-task` only when a current `prd_audit` **FIXABLE** or as-built **REMEDIABLE** finding
  is admitted by an existing active-plan task's **Done when**. It is never valid for a `build_stall`
  question or a finish failure.
  Its `tasks` must be non-empty bindings whose `id` values are real active-plan task IDs; it never
  creates new remediation tasks.
  Use `publication` when the shipped code is already correct and the ONLY defect is in what the
  pull request *says* — a placeholder or wrong-template body, a stale title, a missing `Closes`
  reference, prose that describes a superseded approach. It routes to `finish`, which owns PR
  prose. Never route a prose-only gap to `build`: re-opening an implementation phase to run a
  `gh pr edit` is the failure this disposition exists to prevent. Conversely, never use
  `publication` when any code, test, spec, or configuration must change — that is `build`.
- `category` — **only** when `disposition == "halt"`: `architectural-clarity` | `product-scope` | `unanswerable` (stall-question only). Otherwise `null`.
- `rationale` — one sentence citing the gap's `file:line` evidence and justifying the disposition. For a **stall-question with `disposition == "build"`**, the rationale contains the **answer to the question**, grounded in the committed artifacts that support it. A `plan` rationale must name the examined plan task IDs and why none admits the fix.
- `tasks` — for an `existing-task` disposition, tasks are required non-empty bindings to real
  active-plan task IDs. For a `publication` disposition, tasks are OPTIONAL and purely
  informational: the `rationale` is the remedy, and nothing is ever appended to the plan (see §5).
  Otherwise:
  **required, non-empty** when `disposition == "build"` (and recommended for `acceptance_specs`/`plan`), EXCEPT for **stall-question answers**, which have `tasks: []` (no further work — the answer in `rationale` is the remedy). Each task is concrete and **file-scoped** (`file:line` + exactly what to change), drawn from the audit evidence. **`[]` for all `halt` dispositions.** A `build` disposition with empty `tasks` is invalid EXCEPT when the input is a `build_stall` stall-question.

Emit one disposition per **blocking** gap. Non-blocking (`ALIGNED` / `ACCEPTED`) FRs are not included.

### 5. Plan-Append Contract

For `build`, `acceptance_specs`, `plan`, and `architecture_review` dispositions, the conductor engine appends each task to the `.docs/plans/{slug}.md` file as a task header for later execution. The append happens at the engine level after remediation completes.

**`existing-task`, `publication`, and `halt` dispositions are excluded from the append.**
`.docs/plans/{slug}.md` is a protected artifact; amending it from a step that is not authoring the
plan raises "Protected artifact self-amendments detected". An existing-task remedy reuses approved
plan work, so it neither appends a task nor spends plan-growth allowance; a PR-prose fix is not plan
work, so the engine appends nothing for it and re-dispatches `finish` instead.

**Task ID Format:**
- Task IDs must be non-empty and match the grammar: `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` (alphanumeric, dots, underscores, hyphens)
- **Gate-source prefix is required:** `rem-<category>-<number>` format. Examples:
  - `rem-fr10-1` — remediation for feature request 10
  - `rem-adr-001` — remediation for ADR drift
  - `rem-test-001` — remediation for test failure
- Empty IDs are rejected and cause the remediation to fail
- IDs without the `rem-` prefix trigger a warning but are not rejected (for backward compatibility)

**Appended Headers:**
Each remediation task is appended as a markdown task header:
```markdown
### Task rem-fr10-1: kids/[id].tsx:119 — read kidIdentityQuery.data?.data?.name...
```

Headers re-parse via the Task 18 grammar and must include:
- 1–6 `#` markers (level 1–6 heading)
- The word `Task` followed by the deterministic ID
- A colon `:` and at least one character of title text

**Engine Behavior:**
1. **Validation:** All task IDs are validated before any append occurs
2. **Atomic write:** Appended tasks are written atomically to the plan file (temp file + rename)
3. **Non-empty content:** Titles must be non-empty strings
4. **Prefix warning:** Tasks without `rem-` prefix are logged but not rejected

- [ ] One disposition per blocking gap or stall-question — nothing blocking omitted
- [ ] HALT used ONLY for `architectural-clarity`, `product-scope`, or (stall-question) `unanswerable`; every other gap/question routed to a step
- [ ] A gap whose ONLY defect is published PR prose (placeholder/wrong-template body, stale title,
      missing `Closes`) uses `publication`, never `build` — and `publication` is not used for any
      gap that requires a code, test, spec, or configuration change
- [ ] Every `build` disposition (gap) has ≥1 concrete, file-scoped task drawn from the evidence; stall-question answers have `tasks: []` and the answer in `rationale`
- [ ] No emitted task removes, replaces, or relaxes existing code, tests, or assertions without
      naming the completed plan task or criterion whose coverage it preserves
- [ ] No emitted task edits one side of a matched pair — an enumeration, registry, vocabulary, id
      list, or grammar duplicated elsewhere — without naming the counterpart or deriving both from
      one source
- [ ] Every task was swept for sibling sites of the same shape, and for what any removal orphans;
      sites found and deliberately excluded are named in the `rationale` with why
- [ ] `category` set iff `disposition == "halt"`; `tasks` empty iff `disposition == "halt"` OR (stall-question answer with `disposition == "build"`)
- [ ] For a stall-question answer (`build_stall` disposition `build`), the `rationale` clearly answers the original question and cites the artifacts that support it

      never to `build` or `acceptance_specs`
- [ ] A `plan` rationale names the examined plan task IDs and why none admits the fix
- [ ] `id` format correct: `prd_audit` rows with `PRD: none` use their report criterion exactly as
      `S<story>.<ordinal>` (e.g. `S5.1`); real `FR-N` rows remain `FR-N`; other sources use
      `build_review:<stem>`, `test:<stem>`, `adr-<stem>`, or `stall:<slug>`
