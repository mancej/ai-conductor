## Purpose

Creates high-quality pull requests by analyzing the actual changes, not parroting planning
artifacts. The PR should tell a reviewer what changed, why, and how to verify it — nothing more.

## Practices

### 1. Gather Context

Collect everything needed to understand the PR. Run these in parallel:

```bash
# Determine base branch (main or master)
git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch'

# Full commit log for this branch
git log --oneline <base>..HEAD

# Stat summary of all changes
git diff --stat <base>..HEAD

# Full diff for analysis (use Agent if very large)
git diff <base>..HEAD
```

Also check for harness artifacts that provide motivation context:
- `.docs/specs/*.md` — design docs (the "why")
- `.docs/stories/*.md` — acceptance criteria
- `.pipeline/conduct-state.json` — feature name if available

### 2. Analyze Changes

Read the diff carefully and categorize what changed:

- **New files** — what do they introduce?
- **Modified files** — what behavior changed?
- **Deleted files** — what was removed and why?
- **Migrations** — any schema changes?
- **Tests** — what's covered?
- **Config/infra** — docker, CI, dependencies?

Group changes by logical area (e.g., "Notifications module", "Auth projection", "Alembic migrations"),
not by file path.

### 3. Write the Title

**Check for project conventions first:**

Look for PR title format conventions in the project's `CLAUDE.md` under a
`### PR Title Format` heading (or similar). Projects may specify their preferred format
(conventional commits, ticket prefixes, etc.). If found, follow those conventions instead
of the defaults below.

**Common project convention examples:**
- Conventional Commits: `feat: add notification channel`, `fix(auth): resolve token expiry`
- Ticket prefix: `[PROJ-123] Add notification channel`
- Type/scope: `feat(notifications): add in-app channel`

**Default rules (when no project convention is defined):**
- **Under 72 characters** — hard limit, no exceptions
- **Imperative mood** — "Add notifications module" not "Added" or "Adding"
- **Specific** — "Add in-app notification channel with persistence" not "Update notifications"
- **No periods** at the end
- If the PR does multiple things, summarize at the highest useful level

Good: `Add Alembic migration baseline and register notifications router`
Bad: `Generate a full Alembic migration baseline for all existing database tables in the project...`

### 4. Write the Body

Use this structure. Every section must earn its place — omit sections that add no value.

```markdown
## Why

1-3 sentences explaining the motivation. What problem does this solve? Why now?
Link to design doc or issue if relevant.

## What Changed

Organized by logical area, not by file. Each area gets a brief explanation of what
changed and why. Use bullet points.

### [Area Name] (e.g., "Alembic Migrations")
- Created baseline migrations for all 11 modules (X tables total)
- Consolidated users + notifications into single migration for FK ordering

### [Area Name] (e.g., "Notifications Module")
- Registered notifications router in main.py (was defined but never mounted)
- Added PgInAppChannel for persistent notification storage

## Testing

How was this verified? Be specific:
- `pytest` — N tests passing, M new
- Manual verification steps taken
- Migration tested: `alembic upgrade head` on clean DB

## Notes for Reviewers (optional)

Anything a reviewer should pay attention to:
- Areas of uncertainty
- Trade-offs made
- Things intentionally left out of scope
```

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Restating the title in the body
- Listing every file changed (the diff shows that)
- Pasting raw planning artifacts (stories, specs) into the body
- Generic filler ("This PR implements the feature as described in the plan")
- Bullet points that just name files without explaining what changed

### 5. Pre-Push Verification

**GATE: `/finish` owns local completion verification.**

Before pushing:

1. **Completion result** — reuse the current passing result already reported by
   `/finish`; do not launch the project's aggregate test command from `/pr`.
2. **Linter** — `npm run lint`, `standardrb`, `ruff check .`, or equivalent. Must pass.
3. **Type checker** — `npx tsc --noEmit`, `mypy .`, or equivalent (if project uses one). Must pass.

If completion verification has not reported a current pass, STOP and route back
to `/finish`; do not infer a pass or run the aggregate command here. If the
linter or type checker fails, fix it and re-run that check. Do NOT push with
known failures — this wastes CI minutes and blocks the PR.

### 6. Create or Update the PR

Publication is engine-owned. Do not invoke a remote Git write or a GitHub write from this host skill.
The finish/publication engine resolves canonical repository and feature provenance, performs the
guarded push and PR create/update, and reports a typed result. For an independently supported
single GitHub operation, write its closed request JSON and invoke only:

```bash
ai-conductor github-operation --request-file <request.json>
```

The request accepts only the registered operation schema; it never accepts raw `gh` or `git`
arguments. A refusal, failure, or partial result is non-success: stop and surface the result rather
than attempting a fallback write. The host supplies no approval hook; when a registered shared
operation needs approval, the engine binds it to that exact canonical request.

For feature-branch publication, return the authored title/body to the finish/publication engine.
It owns the guarded remote write and PR operation; do not substitute a direct command, including a
force or lease variant. Report the returned PR URL after an executed result.

**Engine Behavior — Halt-PR Rehabilitation (automated after PR is created/updated).**
When the engine creates or updates a PR that replaces a reused halt PR (one with title
prefixed `needs-remediation:` or the `needs-remediation` label), your job is to
generate a fresh title and body as described in §3 and §4 above. You do NOT need
to remove the halt signal or clear the label yourself — the conductor's finish
step automatically rehabilitates the PR after you complete:

- The engine removes the `needs-remediation` label (if present)
- The engine rewrites the title to remove `needs-remediation:` prefix (if stale)
- The engine injects or updates the `Closes` reference to match the implementation
- The engine flips the PR from draft to ready (if it was drafted)
- The engine posts the halt history (original halt title, banner, halt reason) as a
  PR **comment**

This means your fresh title/body (from §3 and §4) and the engine's rehabilitation
happen in sequence. The finish completion gate verifies the final PR state does NOT
start with `needs-remediation:` (adr-2026-07-03-halt-pr-rehabilitation-at-finish).

**The body is always the plain template — writing it is YOUR job, not the
engine's.** A rehabilitated PR gets the same body shape as a clean first-pass
finish: `## Why` / `## What Changed` / `## Testing` (+ optional
`## Notes for Reviewers`) and the `Closes #N` reference. Never write remediation
prose, halt narrative, "rehabilitated from…" footnotes, or recovery history into
the body — that content belongs in the engine-posted PR comment. The engine's
deterministic body floor exists only as a last resort when `/pr` did not run at
all; if you see a floored body (`<!-- conductor:pr-body-floor -->`) on a PR you
are updating, replace it wholesale with real prose.

### 7. Verify

- [ ] Title is under 72 characters
- [ ] Title uses imperative mood
- [ ] Body "Why" section explains motivation, not just what
- [ ] Body "What Changed" is organized by logical area
- [ ] No file-by-file listing in the body
- [ ] No pasted planning artifacts or boilerplate
- [ ] Testing section describes actual verification performed
- [ ] Completion verification already passed; `/pr` launched no aggregate test command
- [ ] Publication engine reported an executed result and returned the PR URL
- [ ] A refused, failed, or partial guarded result was surfaced with no fallback write
- [ ] PR URL displayed to user
