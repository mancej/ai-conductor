## Purpose

Validates that implemented stories actually work by exercising the running application.
Automated tests verify code correctness; manual testing verifies the system works end-to-end
as a user would experience it.

**Correctness gate:** a "story X passes" result is a claim. Per the `/verify-claims` protocol, a
pass is `verified` — you actually observed the response/behavior — never assumed from the code or
inferred from a green unit test. If a story was not actually exercised, do not claim it passed;
report it as untested rather than presenting an assumption as a result.

**Runs at SHIP as a member of the concurrent validation group — fanned out alongside
`/prd-audit` and `/architecture-review --as-built` in daemon/auto runs. In interactive
runs it stays in the configured SHIP sequence, with its post-step
checkpoint unchanged.**

## Practices

### 0. Feature Type Check

Before starting manual testing, check the stories in `.docs/stories/` for this feature:
- If **no stories reference HTTP endpoints, API routes, or user-facing UI**, report SKIP:
  "Manual test skipped — feature has no endpoint/UI criteria (services, jobs, mailers, CI)."
- Suggest console-based verification instead: `rails console` smoke test or script execution.
- Display the skip reason to the user, then **record it via the CLI** — this is the sole
  way the step is marked done; there is no hand-written marker path:
  ```
  ai-conductor manual-test-record --skip --reason "<reason>" --pipeline-dir /abs/path/to/.pipeline
  ```
  Use the absolute worktree `.pipeline` path supplied in the step's system prompt (see the
  "Daemon mode" note under Step 5 for why it must be absolute, not relative).

### 1. Detect Project Type

| Indicator | Testing Method |
|---|---|
| API-only (no views) | `curl` commands against running server |
| Full-stack (views exist) | Browser automation via Chrome MCP or Capybara |

For a full-stack project, verify that the already-configured browser driver and browser runtime
are available and can launch before exercising browser criteria. **Do not install browser packages,
binaries, or system dependencies during `manual-test`/SHIP.**

- If the browser driver, browser binary, or required launch capability is missing or cannot start,
  record each affected browser criterion as `WARN`. Include the exact dependency/launch error and a
  concrete recovery command in Notes, then continue exercising any API criteria with `curl`.
- A `WARN` is non-blocking capability evidence. It does not enter the bug loop or route back to BUILD.
- Once a browser session launches, an observed mismatch between expected and actual application
  behavior is `FAIL`, even if other criteria are `WARN`. Do not relabel an application failure as an
  environment warning.

### 2. Start the Application

Ensure the application is running and accessible:

**Rails:**
```bash
# Start server in background
bin/rails server -d -p 3000
# Or if using Docker:
docker compose up -d
```

**Node:**
```bash
npm start &
# Or: npm run dev &
```

**Always stop and restart the server before testing.** A stale server from a prior session
runs old code and gives false results. Kill any existing server process, then start fresh:

```bash
# Kill existing server (check common ports)
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true  # Rails
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true  # FastAPI/Django
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true  # Vite

# Start fresh
```

After starting, verify it's up: `curl -s http://localhost:3000/up` (or health check endpoint).

### 3. Walk Through Stories (API Projects)

For each story in `.docs/stories/`, execute the acceptance criteria manually using `curl`:

```bash
# Story: Create a short link (happy path)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/links \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"link": {"original_url": "https://example.com"}}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Story: Expired link returns 410 (negative path)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/abc123
# Expected: 410
```

**For each story, record:**

| Story | Criterion | Expected | Actual | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create link | 201 with short_code | 201 + 6-char code | 201 + "xK9mR2" | PASS |
| Expired link | 410 Gone | 410 | 410 | PASS |
| Invalid URL | 422 with error | 422 | 500 Internal Server Error | **FAIL** |

### 4. Walk Through Stories (Full-Stack Projects)

Use browser automation (Chrome MCP if configured, otherwise manual Capybara-style):

1. Navigate to each page referenced in stories
2. Perform the actions described in Given/When/Then
3. Verify visible output matches expected behavior
4. Take screenshots of key states as manual-test evidence

### 5. Display Results

Display results to the user in the conversation, then **record them via the CLI** —
`manual-test-record` is the sole intended writer of `.pipeline/manual-test-results.md`;
do not hand-write or append to that file yourself. The conductor's completion gate reads
this file to verify manual-test ran for the current feature — without it, the step has no
objective on-disk evidence and cannot pass.

Record the run by piping (or pointing at) the results content and the absolute worktree
`.pipeline` path supplied in the step's system prompt:

```
ai-conductor manual-test-record --results - --pipeline-dir /abs/path/to/.pipeline <<'EOF'
<results table + bugs section, in the format below>
EOF
```

or, if the results were written to a file first:

```
ai-conductor manual-test-record --results /path/to/results.md --pipeline-dir /abs/path/to/.pipeline
```

`manual-test-record` handles the append semantics (new `## Attempt N — <ISO timestamp>`
section, LATEST-attempt gate evaluation, whitewash-guard bookkeeping) — you supply only the
current attempt's table and bug list; do not construct attempt headers or timestamps
yourself.

**Append, never overwrite.** Each invocation of `manual-test-record --results` adds a new
`## Attempt N — <ISO timestamp>` section to the file (the CLI creates the file with
`## Attempt 1 — …` on the first run). The conductor's gate evaluates only the LATEST attempt
section, so a fixed old FAIL doesn't block you — but the history of what earlier attempts
found is preserved for audit, because the CLI is the only writer and it never truncates.

Use this format for the content you pass to `--results` (both in chat and to the CLI):

```
# Manual Test Results
**Server:** localhost:3000
**Tester:** Claude (automated curl) / User (browser)

## Attempt 1 — 2026-07-06T10:00:00Z

| Story | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | PASS/FAIL/WARN | ... |

### Bugs Found
1. **BUG-001:** Invalid URL returns 500 instead of 422 (story: create-link, negative path: invalid input)
2. **BUG-002:** ...
```

`.pipeline/manual-test-results.md` is gitignored, so it is never committed —
which is what the conductor's freshness check needs (the file's mtime must be
newer than the current session's start; a committed copy from a prior run
would defeat that).

**Daemon mode — record to the retained worktree.** Daemon/auto Push & PR outcomes retain the
feature worktree through manual testing; only the engine mergeable sweep cleans it after the
shipped record is proven on `origin/<default>`. The feature's `.pipeline` lives in that worktree. Run
`manual-test-record` against the **absolute worktree `.pipeline` path** (the conductor
supplies it in the step's system prompt) — never a relative `.pipeline/...` path. A relative write
can land in the wrong checkout and the gate (which reads the retained worktree) never sees it.

**Refusal contract:** `manual-test-record` is the sole intended writer of
`.pipeline/manual-test-results.md` — never hand-write, append to, or fabricate that file. If
you cannot actually run the CLI (e.g. no pipeline directory was supplied, or the command
fails), do NOT consider manual_test complete and do NOT invent a marker to paper over it —
HALT and report the blocker. An absent or stale marker is the correct refusal signal the
conductor watches for; a hand-written one defeats the gate's whole purpose (objective,
CLI-verified on-disk evidence rather than a self-reported claim).

**Whitewash guard (#367):** when the gate observes FAIL rows it records the
current commit sha; a later attempt with no FAIL rows is accepted only if
new commits exist since that sha. Recording PASS without actually committing a
fix will be refused by the gate — the fix in Step C below MUST land as commits
before the re-verify attempt. In daemon runs, a manual_test that keeps failing
is kicked back to the build step with the FAIL rows as evidence (bounded), then
HALTs for a human if the bug survives the kickback budget.

`WARN` rows are recorded visibly and marked by the CLI as warning-bearing attempts, but they do not
block the gate. They also cannot whitewash a prior `FAIL`: after a recorded failure, a later
FAIL-free attempt containing PASS and/or WARN rows still requires HEAD to move. Only unavailable or
unlaunchable browser automation dependencies qualify for this warning path; observed application
behavior that violates a story remains `FAIL`.

### 6. Bug Loop

**Any FAIL result becomes a bug that loops back through `/tdd`. WARN results do not:**

**Step A — Confirm the buggy code path is supposed to exist** (the `/debugging` Phase 4
GATE). Manual-test surfaces defects on *shipped* code — read the governing APPROVED ADR/PRD for
the affected component first. If the buggy path violates or is superseded by an approved
decision, the fix is a **conformance finding (kickback), not a patch** — a bug on a condemned
path is a removal signal. This cheap design check precedes the expensive RED→fix→suite cycle.

**Step B — If the cause is not obvious, discover it before fixing.** A manual FAIL gives you the
*symptom* (e.g. "500 instead of 422"), not the *cause*. When you cannot point to the root cause
with confidence from the failure alone, do NOT guess a fix or a reproducing test — dispatch the
`/debugging` protocol (root cause before fix; no fixes without evidence) in a fresh sub-session,
handing it the failing story, the observed-vs-expected result, and any server output/logs. Come
back with an evidence-backed root cause, then proceed. Skip this step only when the cause is
genuinely self-evident from the failure.

**Step C — Fix via TDD, now that the cause is known:**
1. Write a failing test that reproduces the bug at the right layer (RED)
2. Fix it (GREEN)
3. Commit
4. Re-run the manual test for that story to verify

**Do NOT proceed to `/finish` with known bugs.** The manual test gate must be clean.

```
/manual-test → bugs found? → /debugging (discover cause, if not obvious) → /tdd (fix each bug) → /manual-test (re-verify) → /finish
```

The loop continues until all stories pass manual testing.

### 7. Shut Down

Stop the application server after testing:

```bash
# Rails
kill $(cat tmp/pids/server.pid)
# Docker
docker compose down
```

## Verification

- [ ] Application started and accessible
- [ ] Every story (happy + negative paths) tested manually
- [ ] Results displayed to user
- [ ] Browser automation availability was checked without installing dependencies; unavailable or
      unlaunchable browser criteria were recorded as WARN with the error and recovery command
- [ ] Every exit path (Step 0 SKIP or Step 5 real-run PASS/FAIL/WARN) ended by actually invoking
      `ai-conductor manual-test-record` (`--skip --reason ...` or `--results ...`) against the
      absolute worktree `.pipeline` path — not a hand-written or fabricated marker
- [ ] All bugs fixed via TDD loop
- [ ] Re-verification passed after bug fixes
- [ ] Application shut down cleanly
