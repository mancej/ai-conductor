## Purpose

The divergent opening of DECIDE: understand intent, gather context, weigh approaches, and decide
**what kind of work this is** — a *product* feature (needs a PRD) or *technical-only* work
(refactor/infra/deps — no PRD). Exploration is a thinking step; its durable outputs are the chosen
approach (to `.memory/decisions/`) and the **track marker** — not a design doc.

**Correctness gate:** approach recommendations and the track decision are load-bearing. Apply the
`/verify-claims` protocol — attach a grounded confidence % to non-trivial claims about the code or
domain, surface every assumption feeding an approach, and HARD-BLOCK (operator approval interactive,
HALT if autonomous) on any unconfirmed assumption that changes which approach or track you pick.

## Boundaries

`explore` writes **no committed `.docs/` design artifact**. It MAY write exactly one committed
marker: `.docs/track/<slug>.md`.

Do NOT:
- Write code, migrations, configs, tests, stubs, plans, stories, or a PRD/design doc
- Create files in `.docs/specs/`, `.docs/plans/`, `.docs/stories/`, etc.
- Invoke `/prd`, `/plan`, `/stories`, or any other skill

Working notes (approaches considered, scratch reasoning) are **ephemeral** — keep them in
`.pipeline/` (gitignored), never in `.docs/`. The PRD is authored by `/prd` (product track only);
stories carry acceptance criteria on **both** tracks.

After the track is decided and the decision persisted, **exit the session immediately**. The
conductor handles the handoff (to `/prd` on the product track, or straight to architecture on the
technical track).

### Documentation-only delivery

Before selecting a normal track, determine whether the request is solely a human-facing
documentation update. A request is documentation-only only when it changes no product/runtime
behavior, machine-consumed contract, configuration semantics, generated artifact, or testable
functional surface. If documentation accompanies any functional change, keep it on the normal
product or technical route; never split it into a separate story, requirement, or plan task.

For an unambiguous documentation-only request with a source issue, deliver it here instead of
authoring SDLC artifacts:

1. Prefer a project-local documentation skill exposed to the host. Delegate the delivery to it
   when available; otherwise make the documentation edit inline.
2. Work on an isolated branch, commit and push the completed documentation change, and open a PR
   whose body contains `Closes <owner/repo#number>` for the source issue. Do not close the issue
   directly; merge-linked closure remains GitHub's responsibility.
3. Verify the PR branch and closing reference, then write this transient result at
   `.pipeline/documentation-delivery.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "branch": "docs/example",
  "prUrl": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123",
  "sourceRef": "owner/repo#123"
}
```

4. Exit immediately. This result is consumed by the conductor and engineer paths as a successful
   terminal delivery; do not write a track marker, PRD, stories, plan, or other DECIDE artifact.

If the request is ambiguous, no source issue exists, or delegation/editing/branch/PR/verification
does not complete, fail closed: do not emit the result and do not claim delivery.

## Practices

### 1. Explore Project Context

Before asking questions, understand what exists. If the conversation already has exploration
results (from `/bootstrap` or a prior Explore agent), summarize what's known and only fill gaps.

When dispatching Explore agents: **max 2**, directory-partitioned (Agent 1: `app/`+`db/`+`config/`;
Agent 2: `spec/`+`.docs/`). Do not delegate memory reading; this active Explore workflow checks
relevant `.memory/` context directly, along with existing `.docs/stories/` for related work.

### 2. Ask Clarifying Questions

One at a time, each building on the last. Focus on **what** the user wants (not how), **who** uses
it, **why** it matters, scope boundaries, and constraints. Stop when you have enough to propose
approaches. Don't over-question.

Ask how comprehensive the fix should be before recommending or confirming an approach.
Do not default silently to minimal, balanced, or comprehensive scope.
If the operator has not answered, stop before approach confirmation. Record the operator’s answer as the scope boundary.

### 3. Propose Approaches

Present 2-3 approaches with clear trade-offs and a recommendation; the user decides.

```markdown
### Approach A: [Name]
**Idea:** [Brief description — behavior/strategy, not mechanism]
**Pros:** … **Cons:** … **Best when:** …
**Est. effort:** [very rough implementation time — e.g. "~1-2h", "~half day", or S/M/L tier]
**Impact:** [one line — value added / what it unblocks]
```

**Est. effort** and **Impact** are REQUIRED on every proposed approach. Keep them rough and
one-line each — they inform the operator's pick, they are not commitments and need no analysis
artifact.

**Embedded Design Divergence Rule:** When the incoming idea carries an embedded solution design
(identified as a filer hypothesis from the engineer step):

- The hypothesis enters as **at most one candidate approach** (not privileged, but present)
- At least **one genuine alternative NOT derived from the filer's sketch MUST be generated** and weighed
- The hypothesis **may still be recommended when it wins on merits** — this rule prevents default adoption
  (anchoring bias), not the idea itself

When the idea has no embedded design, behavior is unchanged; no added ceremony.

### 4. Decide the Track (product vs technical)

Classify the work and **get the operator to confirm** — this gates whether a PRD is authored:

- **product** — user-facing capability/behavior with requirements worth a PRD.
- **technical** — refactor, infra, dependency, internal tooling: no product requirements; acceptance
  criteria will live directly in stories. No PRD.

Present it like: `Track: TECHNICAL (dependency upgrade, no user-facing behavior). Override? [product/technical/accept]`

Misclassification is a real risk (a product feature mislabeled technical ships with no requirements),
so do NOT finalize silently — the operator must confirm. On confirmation write
`.docs/track/<slug>.md`:

```markdown
# Track: <feature>

Track: product   # or: technical

Scope boundary: <operator-confirmed breadth and exclusions>

<one line of rationale>
```

### 5. Persist the Decision, Then Exit

- **Memory (`.memory/decisions/`)** — persist the **selected approach and why the alternatives were
  rejected**. This is exploration's one durable thinking output; the ephemeral `.pipeline/` notes are
  discarded. Only persist when the trade-off is non-obvious.
- **Exit immediately.** Do NOT suggest the next skill — the conductor routes to `/prd` (product) or
  architecture (technical).

## Constraints

- **HARD CONSTRAINT: `explore` MUST NEVER call `ExitPlanMode`.** It produces no implementation plan;
  calling it makes `/conduct` mark the step failed. Decide the track, persist, and return.

## Verification

- [ ] Project context explored before asking questions
- [ ] Questions asked one at a time (not batched)
- [ ] 2-3 approaches presented with trade-offs + a recommendation
- [ ] Every approach carries **Est. effort** and **Impact** lines
- [ ] Track decided AND operator-confirmed; `.docs/track/<slug>.md` written
- [ ] **No `.docs/` design artifact written (specs/stories/plans); notes kept in `.pipeline/`**
- [ ] Selected approach + rejected alternatives persisted to `.memory/decisions/` (if non-obvious)
- [ ] `ExitPlanMode` was NOT called
- [ ] Session exited immediately after the track decision
