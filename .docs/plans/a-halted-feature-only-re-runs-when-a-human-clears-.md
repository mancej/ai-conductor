# Implementation Plan: retry at the raiser, and operator budget recovery (#2190)

**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Stories:** .docs/stories/a-halted-feature-only-re-runs-when-a-human-clears-.md
**Conflict check:** Clean as of 2026-09-05 (one blocking overlap resolved by architecture-review condition 3; see the conflict report of the same date)

## Summary

Bounded retries where retry is safe (validation-group member budget, a suite-infrastructure lane), three budget halts reclassified so no sweep auto-clears them, and the `kickback-budget inspect|reset|raise` command family from adr-2026-08-29 with a `--gate` selector, consumed by the daemon at its halted-feature boundary. 19 tasks.

## Technical Approach

- **Group member budget (Story 1).** The two validation-group member dispatch sites in `src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts` pass a trailing literal `1` as the attempt budget. Replace both with the resolved serial attempt budget the serial path already computes (search: `runValidationGroup`, the `onMemberEvent` callback, the trailing numeric argument after it). No new counter: escalation still derives from `attempt` (adr-2026-07-05 §7).
- **Suite-infrastructure lane (Story 2).** In the `test_suite` branch where `fullSuiteFailure.reason !== 'nonzero_exit'` writes an immediate `needs-human` halt, insert a bounded lane shaped like the build-review mechanical-fault lane (adr-2026-08-18 D3–D5): a `suiteInfrastructureRetries` counter on the `test_suite` gate entry of `.pipeline/kickback-ledger.json`, a `MAX_SUITE_INFRASTRUCTURE_RETRIES` constant in `kickback-ledger.ts`, a `step_retry` emission with an infrastructure reason, then an in-step re-run. The counter is lap-counting (credited by rebase invalidation like `mechanicalFaults`), never charges `count`/`cumulative`, and is read fail-closed: unreadable → treated as spent. Search hints: `bumpMechanicalFaultsInLedger`, `MAX_MECHANICAL_FAULTS_BUILD_REVIEW`, `creditKickbackGateLaps`.
- **Budget-halt classes (Story 3).** Three `writeHaltMarker(…, 'mechanical')` sites — the manual-test cap, the test_suite cap, and the serial "Remediation budget exhausted (max N kickbacks per gate)" halt — pass `needs-human`. `HaltClass`, `readHaltClass`, `isOperatorActionHalt`, the legacy migration, and `rekickSweep` are untouched; the exclusion of live-boundary and seal halts is proven by tests over the unchanged sweep, not by new code.
- **Ledger extension (Stories 4–7, adr-2026-08-29 D1/D2, adr-2026-08-31).** `KickbackGateEntry` gains optional `effectiveLimit` (build_review cumulative), `effectiveLapCap` (prd_audit / as-built), `adjustments` (history), `pendingAdjustment`, `capEvidence` (gate, consumed, limit, latest reason, `haltGeneration`), and `resumeAuthorization` (adjustment id + generation + consumed flag). All are non-lap-counting except nothing; `creditKickbackGateLaps` must preserve them. The validator validates enforcement values and history independently (08-31 §2), scopes invalidity to the gate (§3), never repairs a field (§4), and the credit path never writes an `effectiveLimit` the validator rejects (§5). Every read-modify-write of the ledger goes through one `withKickbackLedgerLease` helper built on `conduct-state-lease.ts` with label `kickback-ledger`; a live or ambiguous owner fails closed (D1).
- **Typed cap evidence.** The three cap terminals (build_review cumulative in `bumpKickbackGate`'s exhausted branch consumer, prd_audit lap cap, as-built lap cap in the remediation routing block) persist `capEvidence` with a fresh generation before `writeHaltMarker`. This is the producer for every generation-match rule downstream.
- **Renderer (D8).** A pure `renderKickbackBudgetView(entry, gate)` in a new `src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-budget-view.ts` produces the human and JSON views; the cumulative-cap halt body and `inspect` both call it.
- **CLI (D3–D5, D7).** `detectKickbackBudgetCommand` in `src/conductor/src/cli.ts` beside `detectDecideGrantCommand`; `dispatchKickbackBudgetCommand` in a new `src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-budget-cli.ts` modeled on `build-review-cli.ts`: `resolveCliFeature` through `resolveMainRepoRoot` + `.worktrees/<slug>` realpath, the interactive-TTY + local-operator refusal, and its `appendEvent` external same-schema sibling-ledger writer. Mutations: ensure park (owned vs pre-existing, `park-marker.ts`), acquire the ledger lease, verify live halt + `capEvidence` + generation agree, stage `pendingAdjustment`, append `kickback_budget_adjustment_authorized` (idempotent by adjustment id), reacquire lease, apply, move to history, install `resumeAuthorization`, remove pending, release owned park. Reconciliation on every command entry finishes or discards a stale pending record by looking up its adjustment id in the sibling ledger. Pre-boot dispatch in `src/conductor/src/index.ts` after `decideGrantCmd`.
- **Daemon boundary (D6, successor D3).** A per-iteration `consumeResumeAuthorizations` sweep in `src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-rekick.ts`, sibling to `rekickSweep` and wired in `daemon-cli.ts` beside it: for each halted worktree, after the operator-park and processed checks and before operator-action retention, read the ledger (fail-closed), match `resumeAuthorization` to live `capEvidence.haltGeneration`, then clear through the existing `clearMarker` (marker + class + REKICK sentinel) and `cleanupHaltPresentation`, mark consumed under the lease, and emit `halt_cleared` with cause `kickback-budget`. It only clears the marker: `pickEligible` and `isHalted` remain the sole dispatch authority (adr-2026-07-04 §3), and the existing rebase-first resume runs from the sentinel.
- **Status.** `daemon-observe-cli.ts` gains a `KICKBACK BUDGET [slug]` line from the same renderer for any feature with an adjustment.
- **Tests.** Unit suites under `src/conductor/test/engine/`: `conductor.test.ts` (search `writeAsBuilt`, `remediation: { enabled: true }` for daemon fixtures), `kickback-ledger.test.ts`, `daemon-rekick.test.ts`, `daemon-cli-rekick-park-wiring.test.ts`, `halt-marker.test.ts`. Mocked provider/step runners only; no real git remote or gh.

## Prerequisites

- Spec #2197 merges first (shared `conductor.ts` regions are disjoint; rebase absorbs it).

## Tasks

### Task 1: Validation-group members get the serial attempt budget
**Story:** 1
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests in the conductor suite: a daemon validation group whose `prd_audit` member throws once then completes joins with no HALT marker; a member that throws on every attempt halts `needs-human` with a reason containing the member name and an attempt count equal to the serial budget; the auth-failure park-and-poll path still consumes no attempt (search `authFailure` fixtures in the existing group tests).
2. Verify RED (today the first case halts after one attempt).
3. Implement: replace the trailing literal `1` at both validation-group member dispatch sites with the resolved serial attempt budget; render the attempt count in the existing no-verdict halt reason.
4. Verify GREEN; existing validation-group join tests pass unchanged; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A conductor test proves a member that throws once then completes yields a group join with no HALT marker and a `prd_audit` verdict.
- [ ] A conductor test proves a member that throws on every attempt halts with class `needs-human` and a reason naming the member and the attempt count.
- [ ] Neither validation-group dispatch site passes a literal attempt budget; both pass the resolved serial budget.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — both member dispatch sites and the no-verdict reason
- src/conductor/test/engine/conductor.test.ts — group budget tests

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 2: Suite-infrastructure retry counter on the ledger
**Story:** 2
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests in the ledger suite: `bumpSuiteInfrastructureRetriesInLedger` increments `gates.test_suite.suiteInfrastructureRetries` and leaves `count`/`cumulative` unchanged; `creditKickbackGateLaps` credits it like `mechanicalFaults`; a non-integer value fails the entry validator for `test_suite` only; `readSuiteInfrastructureRetries` returns `'unreadable'` for a malformed entry.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: add `MAX_SUITE_INFRASTRUCTURE_RETRIES = 2`, the optional `suiteInfrastructureRetries` field, the bump helper (atomic temp+rename like the existing writer), the credit rule, and the fail-closed reader.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] `kickback-ledger.test.ts` proves the bump increments only `suiteInfrastructureRetries` and rebase credit resets it.
- [ ] `kickback-ledger.test.ts` proves a malformed `suiteInfrastructureRetries` invalidates only the `test_suite` entry and the reader reports `'unreadable'`.
- [ ] `MAX_SUITE_INFRASTRUCTURE_RETRIES` is exported and equals 2.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts — field, constant, bump, credit, reader
- src/conductor/test/engine/kickback-ledger.test.ts — counter tests

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 3: test_suite infrastructure failure re-runs within the step
**Story:** 2
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests in the conductor suite with a fake full-suite verifier: `FAILED` with reason `timeout` then a pass → the step completes, exactly one `step_retry` event carries an infrastructure reason, and `count`/`cumulative` on `test_suite` are unchanged; reason `nonzero_exit` → the existing code-repair kickback route and no lane entry.
2. Verify RED (today the timeout halts immediately).
3. Implement: in the `fullSuiteFailure.reason !== 'nonzero_exit'` branch, read the counter fail-closed; when below the constant, bump it, emit `step_retry` `{ step: 'test_suite', attempt, reason }`, and re-run the verifier; otherwise fall through to the halt in Task 4.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A conductor test proves a `timeout` then pass completes `test_suite` with one `step_retry` event carrying an infrastructure reason and unchanged `count`/`cumulative`.
- [ ] A conductor test proves `nonzero_exit` takes the existing kickback route and leaves `suiteInfrastructureRetries` absent.
- [ ] The lane is reached only from the non-`nonzero_exit` verifier branch of the `test_suite` step.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — test_suite infrastructure branch
- src/conductor/test/engine/conductor.test.ts — lane tests

**Dependencies:** 2

### Task 4: Suite-infrastructure exhaustion and unreadable counter halt needs-human
**Story:** 2
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: a verifier that fails with `spawn_failed` on every run halts after `MAX_SUITE_INFRASTRUCTURE_RETRIES` re-runs with class `needs-human`, a body containing the reason, the retries spent, and `.pipeline/test-suite-evidence.json`; a malformed counter halts `needs-human` naming the counter as unreadable without re-running; a counter of 1 persisted before a simulated re-dispatch continues to 2 and then halts.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement the exhaustion and unreadable branches on the lane from Task 3.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A conductor test proves exhaustion writes `HALT.class` `needs-human` and a body naming the verifier reason and the retries spent.
- [ ] A conductor test proves a malformed counter halts without invoking the verifier again.
- [ ] A conductor test proves the counter continues from its persisted value across a re-dispatch.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — exhaustion and unreadable branches
- src/conductor/test/engine/conductor.test.ts — negative tests

**Dependencies:** 3

### Task 5: Three budget halts are classified needs-human
**Story:** 3
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests reading `HALT.class` after each halt: manual-test FAIL unresolved at the per-gate cap, test_suite failure unresolved at the per-gate cap, and the serial "Remediation budget exhausted" halt.
2. Verify RED (each reads `mechanical`).
3. Implement: pass `needs-human` at those three `writeHaltMarker`/`haltSerialExecution` sites; change nothing else about their bodies.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Three conductor tests each read `HALT.class` as `needs-human` for the manual-test cap, the test_suite cap, and the per-gate remediation-budget halt.
- [ ] The `HaltClass` union in `halt-marker.ts` is byte-for-byte unchanged in this diff.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — three halt-class arguments
- src/conductor/test/engine/conductor.test.ts — class tests

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 6: The re-kick sweep retains every judgement halt and still clears mechanical
**Story:** 3
**Type:** negative-path
**Verify-only:** yes

**Steps:**
1. In the daemon-rekick suite, drive `rekickSweep` over worktrees carrying `needs-human`, `plan-gap`, `unclassified`, and `protected-artifact` with no operator authorization present and assert each is skipped with a logged disposition, and over a `mechanical` worktree and assert it is cleared with the REKICK sentinel written; assert a `legacy` sidecar is left as-is by `migrateLegacyHaltClasses`.
2. Where an assertion already exists, cite it; add only the missing cases.
3. Commit with `Evidence: satisfied-by` or a test-only commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] `daemon-rekick.test.ts` proves `needs-human`, `plan-gap`, and `unclassified` halts are skipped by the sweep and `mechanical` is cleared.
- [ ] A test proves a live-boundary halt body and a seal halt body are unchanged after a sweep pass.
- [ ] No production file changes in this task.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/test/engine/daemon-rekick.test.ts — retention matrix

**Dependencies:** 5

### Task 7: Ledger gate entry carries budget-recovery fields and validates them independently
**Story:** 5
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing ledger tests: an entry with `effectiveLimit`, `effectiveLapCap`, `adjustments`, `pendingAdjustment`, `capEvidence`, and `resumeAuthorization` round-trips; malformed `adjustments` marks history unavailable while `effectiveLimit` still reads (08-31 §2); a malformed `effectiveLimit` invalidates only that gate (§3) and is never defaulted (§4); `creditKickbackGateLaps` preserves all six fields (D2); `bumpKickbackGate` reports `cumulativeExhausted` against `effectiveLimit` when present.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement the fields, the validator branches, the non-lap-counting exemption, and the effective-limit comparison.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] `kickback-ledger.test.ts` proves the six fields round-trip and survive `creditKickbackGateLaps`.
- [ ] `kickback-ledger.test.ts` proves malformed history is reported unavailable while validated enforcement values are preserved, and a malformed `effectiveLimit` invalidates only its gate.
- [ ] `bumpKickbackGate` reports `cumulativeExhausted` at `effectiveLimit` when present and at the default constant otherwise.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts — fields, validator, credit exemption, exhaustion comparison
- src/conductor/test/engine/kickback-ledger.test.ts — schema tests

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 8: Every ledger read-modify-write runs under one feature-local lease
**Story:** 5
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: `withKickbackLedgerLease` serializes two concurrent bumps (both increments land); a live foreign owner makes the operation refuse with a typed failure and leave the ledger unchanged; the lease file carries label `kickback-ledger`.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement `withKickbackLedgerLease` on `conduct-state-lease.ts` and route `bumpKickbackGateInLedger`, `bumpMechanicalFaultsInLedger`, the Task 2 bump, `recordGrowth`, and the credit writer through it.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] `kickback-ledger.test.ts` proves two concurrent bumps both land and a live foreign owner refuses with the ledger unchanged.
- [ ] Every exported ledger writer in `kickback-ledger.ts` calls `withKickbackLedgerLease`.
- [ ] The lease label is `kickback-ledger`.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts — lease wrapper and writer routing
- src/conductor/test/engine/kickback-ledger.test.ts — lease tests

**Dependencies:** 7

### Task 9: Typed cap evidence is persisted before each cap halt
**Story:** 5
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing conductor tests: reaching the build_review cumulative cap, the prd_audit lap cap, and the as-built lap cap each leave `capEvidence` on the gate entry (gate, consumed, limit, latest reason, a fresh `haltGeneration`) before the halt marker exists; a second halt on the same gate carries a different generation.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: at each terminal, write `capEvidence` under the lease, then call the existing halt writer.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Three conductor tests each read `capEvidence` with a `haltGeneration` from the ledger after the cap halt for build_review, prd_audit, and architecture_review_as_built.
- [ ] A test proves two successive cap halts on one gate carry distinct generations.
- [ ] The halt marker mtime is later than the ledger write in each test.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — three cap terminals
- src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts — evidence writer
- src/conductor/test/engine/conductor.test.ts — terminal tests

**Dependencies:** 8

### Task 10: One renderer for the budget view and the cap halt body
**Story:** 4
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: `renderKickbackBudgetView` on a fixture entry yields consumed, limit, remaining, latest reason, adjustment history, and a separate mechanical-fault section for build_review, and laps/lap-cap for the two remediation gates; a legacy entry reports history unavailable; the build_review cumulative-cap halt body contains the renderer's text for the same entry.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement `kickback-budget-view.ts` (pure) and call it from the cumulative-cap halt terminal.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A test proves the renderer output for a fixture entry contains consumed, limit, remaining, latest reason, and a history section, with mechanical faults listed separately.
- [ ] A conductor test proves the cumulative-cap halt body contains the renderer output for the same entry.
- [ ] A test proves a legacy entry renders history as unavailable and never infers it from the reason text.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-budget-view.ts — renderer
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — halt body composition
- src/conductor/test/engine/kickback-budget-view.test.ts — renderer tests

**Dependencies:** 9

### Task 11: kickback-budget command parsing, pre-boot dispatch, and refusals
**Story:** 5
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: `detectKickbackBudgetCommand` parses `inspect --feature X [--format json]`, `reset --feature X --gate G --rationale R`, `raise --feature X --gate G --by N --rationale R`, and returns null on any other argv; dispatch refuses (exit 2, no file created) for a non-TTY on reset/raise, an empty rationale, `--by` of `0`, `-1`, or `1.5`, an unknown gate, and an unresolved feature; `inspect` runs without a TTY.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement the parser in `cli.ts`, `dispatchKickbackBudgetCommand` in `kickback-budget-cli.ts` with the `build-review-cli.ts` feature resolution and interactive-operator refusal, and the pre-boot branch in `index.ts` after `decideGrantCmd`.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A cli test proves all three subcommands parse and every malformed argv returns null.
- [ ] Tests prove each refusal (non-TTY mutation, empty rationale, non-positive or non-integer `--by`, unknown gate, unresolved feature) exits non-zero and creates no park, lease, or ledger change.
- [ ] `index.ts` dispatches `kickback-budget` before the pipeline boots, proven by an index dispatch test.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/cli.ts — parser
- src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-budget-cli.ts — dispatch and refusals
- src/conductor/src/index.ts — pre-boot branch
- src/conductor/test/engine/kickback-budget-cli.test.ts — parser and refusal tests

**Dependencies:** 10

### Task 12: kickback-budget inspect renders every gate
**Story:** 4
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: inspect on a fixture ledger prints both `build_review` and `prd_audit` views with remaining 0 and exits 0; `--format json` prints one JSON document with per-gate fields and an `adjustments` array; malformed history prints values with history unavailable; a legacy entry prints defaults as authoritative.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement inspect over Task 10's renderer with a read-only ledger read (no lease).
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A test proves human inspect lists both gates with consumed, limit, remaining, and latest reason.
- [ ] A test proves `--format json` emits a single parseable document with an `adjustments` array (empty when none).
- [ ] Tests prove malformed-history and legacy entries render as unavailable rather than invented.

**Files likely touched:**

**Dependencies:** 11

### Task 13: raise and reset stage, authorize, apply, and record under quiescence
**Story:** 5
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests with a fake park store, lease, and sibling event writer: `raise --gate build_review --by 1` on a feature with matching `capEvidence` creates an owned park, stages `pendingAdjustment`, appends one `kickback_budget_adjustment_authorized` event keyed by adjustment id, applies `effectiveLimit + 1` with `cumulative` unchanged, appends history, installs `resumeAuthorization` bound to the id and generation, removes the pending record, and releases only the owned park; a pre-existing park is preserved and the output names the unpark action; `reset` zeroes `cumulative` and keeps `effectiveLimit`; every other gate, `growth`, `count`, and mechanical fields are unchanged; a held lease or a generation mismatch refuses with no change.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement the mutation path: park (owned vs existing) → lease → verify live halt class + `capEvidence` + generation → stage → append event → reacquire → apply + history + authorization + unpending → release owned park. Declare the new event in `types/events.ts` and `event-sinks.ts`.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A test proves raise applies `effectiveLimit + N` with `cumulative` unchanged, appends exactly one history record and one sibling-ledger event, and installs a resume authorization bound to the adjustment id and halt generation.
- [ ] A test proves reset zeroes `cumulative` and preserves a raised `effectiveLimit`, and a before/after comparison proves other gates, growth, count, and mechanical fields are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- [ ] Tests prove a pre-existing park is preserved with the unpark action printed, and that a held lease or generation mismatch refuses with the ledger unchanged.
- [ ] `kickback_budget_adjustment_authorized` is declared in the sink registry with persist and audit set to true.

**Files likely touched:**

**Dependencies:** 11

### Task 14: An interrupted adjustment reconciles exactly once
**Story:** 5
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: a ledger with a `pendingAdjustment` whose id has no sibling-ledger event is discarded on the next command entry with active fields unchanged; a pending record whose event exists is applied exactly once and no second event is appended; an unreadable sibling ledger leaves the pending record and refuses the command.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement command-entry reconciliation keyed on the adjustment id.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A test proves a pending record with no event is discarded and active fields are unchanged.
- [ ] A test proves a pending record with an event is applied once and the event count is unchanged afterward.
- [ ] A test proves an unreadable sibling ledger keeps the pending record and exits non-zero.

**Files likely touched:**

**Dependencies:** 13

### Task 15: Remediation gates honor a feature-local lap cap and reset
**Story:** 6
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: `remediationGateAppendBudget` resolves `lapCap` to `effectiveLapCap` when the gate entry carries one and to the config value otherwise; `raise --gate prd_audit --by 1` writes `effectiveLapCap` configured+1 and leaves `laps` unchanged; `reset --gate architecture_review_as_built` zeroes `laps` and keeps `effectiveLapCap`.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement the lap-cap read in the append-budget resolution and the two gate branches in the CLI apply step.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A conductor test proves the append budget uses `effectiveLapCap` when present and the config cap otherwise.
- [ ] A test proves raise on `prd_audit` yields `effectiveLapCap` of configured plus N with `laps` unchanged.
- [ ] A test proves reset on the as-built gate zeroes `laps` and keeps `effectiveLapCap`.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — lap-cap resolution

- src/conductor/test/engine/kickback-budget-cli.test.ts — gate tests

**Dependencies:** 13

### Task 16: Lap credit and validation never widen an authorized limit
**Story:** 5
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: after a raise, a rebase-invalidation credit leaves `effectiveLimit` and `effectiveLapCap` intact; re-reading through `readKickbackLedger` after every CLI write in the suite validates; a ledger whose `resumeAuthorization` is malformed reads as having no authorization while enforcement values still read.
2. Verify RED where a case fails.
3. Implement any missing validator or credit branch.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A test proves a credit after a raise preserves `effectiveLimit` and `effectiveLapCap`.
- [ ] Every CLI mutation test re-reads the ledger through `readKickbackLedger` and asserts it validates.
- [ ] A test proves a malformed `resumeAuthorization` reads as absent without invalidating enforcement values.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts — validator or credit branch if needed
- src/conductor/test/engine/kickback-ledger.test.ts — credit and validation tests

**Dependencies:** 15

### Task 17: The daemon consumes a matching authorization and clears the halt atomically
**Story:** 7
**Type:** happy-path

> **Amended 2026-09-08 by #2190:** Task 17's `halt_cleared` evidence requirement is satisfied by routing the occurrence through its declared feature audit consumer. It does not authorize deriving `TerminalSubscriber`'s interactive event list from `EVENT_SINKS.render`; that registry governs daemon rendering, while the terminal subscriber retains its intentionally explicit list. This correction records the operator's refusal of NC.3 after remediation language incorrectly treated the audit sink and UI subscriber as counterpart lists.

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests in the daemon-rekick suite for `consumeResumeAuthorizations`: a halted worktree with a valid unconsumed authorization matching `capEvidence.haltGeneration` and no park is cleared (marker, class sidecar, presentation) via the existing clear path, the authorization is marked consumed under the lease, a `halt_cleared` event with cause `kickback-budget` is emitted, and the REKICK sentinel exists; a stale generation, an operator park, a `partial` presentation clear, and an unreadable ledger each retain the halt, leave the authorization unconsumed, and dispatch nothing. Wire it in `daemon-cli.ts` beside the rekick sweep binding and prove per-iteration invocation in the wiring suite.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement the sweep and its wiring; it never dispatches — `pickEligible` sees the cleared marker on the next poll.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] `daemon-rekick.test.ts` proves a matching authorization clears the halt through `clearMarker` and `cleanupHaltPresentation`, marks it consumed, emits `halt_cleared` with cause `kickback-budget`, and writes the REKICK sentinel.
- [ ] Tests prove stale generation, operator park, partial clear, and unreadable ledger each retain the halt with the authorization unconsumed and no dispatch.
- [ ] A daemon-cli wiring test proves the sweep runs each loop iteration ahead of operator-action retention and after the park and processed checks.

**Dependencies:** 16

### Task 18: daemon status shows the adjustment and remaining allowance
**Story:** 7
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write a failing renderer test: `daemon status` for a repo whose feature ledger carries an adjustment prints a `KICKBACK BUDGET [slug]` line with the gate, adjustment kind, and remaining allowance from Task 10's renderer; a feature with no adjustment prints no such line.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement the section in `daemon-observe-cli.ts` beside the plan-growth section.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A status test proves a feature with an adjustment prints gate, kind, and remaining allowance.

### Task 19: A resumed feature enforces the adjusted budget from the ledger
**Story:** 7
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Extend an existing resume-entry test with a ledger fixture: after the Task 17 clear, the feature's first dispatched step is the step after its last completed one; the raised gate then enforces `effectiveLimit` (or `effectiveLapCap`) from the ledger while repository config still holds the default.
2. Verify RED where the assertion fails.
3. Implement nothing new unless RED reveals a gap in Tasks 7–17; otherwise record the verification.
4. Commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] A resume test proves the first dispatched step after an authorized clear is the step after the last completed one.
- [ ] A test proves the raised gate halts at the ledger's effective limit while config still holds the default.

### Task 20: Progress re-kick and episode-end recovery share the sweep's retention predicate
**Story:** 3
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: the progress re-kick eligibility predicate returns false for a worktree whose `HALT.class` reads `needs-human`, `plan-gap`, `kickback-cap`, `over-scope`, or is unreadable, and still returns true for a `mechanical` worktree with forward progress; the episode-end sweep leaves a `needs-human` stamped worktree halted and still clears a `mechanical` one.
2. Verify RED (today both paths consult only task-count growth and operator park).
3. Implement: extract the base-advance sweep's class-based retention decision into one exported predicate in `daemon-rekick.ts`, call it from `rekickSweep` in place of its inline block, and consult the same predicate from `buildProgressReKickDeps` and from the episode-end sweep in `daemon-cli.ts`.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] One exported retention predicate in `daemon-rekick.ts` is the only place an automatic path decides that a classified human halt is retained.
- [ ] A daemon-cli test proves the progress re-kick predicate returns false for a retained halt class and true for a `mechanical` worktree with forward progress.
- [ ] A daemon-cli test proves the episode-end sweep leaves a retained halt in place and still clears a `mechanical` one.
- [ ] `rekickSweep` calls the shared predicate rather than its own inline class check, and its existing retention tests pass unchanged.

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-rekick.ts — shared retention predicate
- src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts — progress re-kick and episode-end sweep
- src/conductor/test/engine/daemon-rekick.test.ts — predicate tests

## Integration Points
- After Task 4: a flaky suite runner no longer pages the operator; a broken one still halts after two re-runs.
- After Task 6: no budget halt is auto-cleared by any sweep.
- After Task 14: an operator can raise or reset from a terminal with exactly-once durability.
- After Task 17: the daemon resumes a feature from an operator adjustment with no config edit and no commit on main.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-adr0831-1: src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts:423-456 - readKickbackLedger must fail closed per adr-2026-08-31 decision 1: return a typed unreadable result instead of emptyLedger() for a malformed envelope, an unsupported version, and a non-ENOENT read error, while a genuinely absent (ENOENT) ledger stays the empty base case; close the same class at the sibling site kickback-ledger.ts:383-406 where normalizeKickbackGateEntry drops a malformed gate entry, so that gate reads unreadable rather than absent while sibling gates keep their counts; route the unreadable result to the existing needs-human halt at every reader - readRemediationGateAppendBudget (src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:714-732), daemon-rekick.ts:49, kickback-budget-cli.ts:38, and the bump/readGrowth writers - and keep src/conductor/test/engine/kickback-ledger.test.ts and daemon-rekick.test.ts assertions delivered by Tasks 6 and 7 passing unchanged
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** adr-2026-08-31 decision 1 forbids degrading malformed or version-incompatible durable budget state to an empty budget, but readKickbackLedger returns emptyLedger() for an unsupported version, a corrupt envelope, and a non-ENOENT read error at src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts:423-456; no active plan task's Done-when admits this repair (Task 7 covers gate-scoped invalidity and round-trip, Task 8 the lease, Task 16 credit preservation), so it is appended as new work. Sibling site of the same shape found and included in the one task: normalizeKickbackGateEntry silently drops a malformed gate entry at kickback-ledger.ts:383-406. Sites found and excluded: none. No existing assertion is removed or relaxed — the fail-open coverage Task 7 and Task 6 delivered (kickback-ledger.test.ts gate-scoped invalidity, daemon-rekick.test.ts boundary retention) must keep passing.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab4-1: src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:10381-10405,10506 — make the build_review effective-pass rollback one leased read-modify-write instead of a whole-ledger snapshot restore: replace the unleased kickbackLedgerBeforeConsumption read at :10506 and the writeKickbackLedger(this.projectRoot, kickbackLedgerBeforeConsumption) restore at :10404 with a single leased refund that reverses only the build_review gate fields this consumption changed (count, cumulative, lastReason, treeHash, chargedEffectIds), leaving every sibling gate, growth, and any concurrently written effectiveLimit/effectiveLapCap/adjustments/pendingAdjustment/resumeAuthorization value read fresh under that same lease; add the refund helper next to the other leased writers in src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts so the read and the write share one withKickbackLedgerLease transaction, cover it with a kickback-ledger test proving a concurrent raise on another gate survives the rollback and a conductor test proving the effective-pass re-entry still restores the build_review count, and keep the Task 16 credit-preservation assertions and the existing build_review effective-pass re-entry assertions passing unchanged
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** Verified, 99%: conductor.ts:10506 snapshots the whole ledger with an unleased readKickbackLedger, consumeKickbackBudget then mutates under its own separate lease, and the effective-pass re-entry at conductor.ts:10404 restores that stale whole-ledger snapshot through writeKickbackLedger, whose lease at kickback-ledger.ts:598-604 covers only the write. A concurrent kickback-budget raise or reset landing between the read and the restore is silently overwritten, contrary to the APPROVED successor D4 requirement that every ledger read-modify-write share one lease transaction. No active plan task's Done-when admits this repair: Task 8's checks are scoped to exported writers inside kickback-ledger.ts (which do take the lease here), Task 16 covers credit and validator preservation, and Task 13/15 cover the CLI mutation path — so it is appended as new work. Sibling sweep of every non-kickback-ledger.ts caller: conductor.ts:10404 is the only read-modify-write outside the module; daemon-observe-cli.ts:493, daemon-rekick.ts:237, build-review-cli.ts:205/377, kickback-budget-cli.ts:46/107/131, conductor.ts:729/2330/6011/8975/9183 are read-only and are found and excluded. No existing assertion is removed or relaxed: Task 16's 'a credit after a raise preserves effectiveLimit and effectiveLapCap' coverage and the existing build_review effective-pass re-entry tests must keep passing unchanged.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab2-1: src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts:519-527 — reject a malformed `pendingAsBuiltRemediationFindings` as a whole-ledger failure per adr-2026-08-25 decision 7 instead of spreading the field out of the parsed result: when the field is present and isPendingAsBuiltRemediationFindings rejects it, return the unreadable-ledger sentinel (kickback-ledger.ts:596-608) rather than a readable ledger with the field absent, keeping a genuinely absent field as the empty base case; bring the matched counterpart along in this same change — Conductor.reloadPendingAsBuiltRemediationFindings at src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:2375-2380 must stop treating the absent field as an empty pending set (`?? []`) and instead route an unreadable ledger to the existing needs-human halt, so parser and projection cannot drift; keep every gate-scoped diagnostic Task 7 delivered passing unchanged (kickback-ledger.test.ts: malformed `adjustments` reports history unavailable, malformed `effectiveLimit` invalidates only its gate, sibling gates keep their counts) — this change adds whole-ledger rejection only for the pending-remediation field and never widens gate-scoped invalidity; add a kickback-ledger test proving a malformed pendingAsBuiltRemediationFindings yields an unreadable ledger while a valid one round-trips, and a conductor test proving the pending as-built projection halts needs-human on that unreadable ledger instead of projecting an empty pending set
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** adr-2026-08-25 decision 7 requires an ill-formed pendingAsBuiltRemediationFindings array to invalidate the whole ledger, but src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-ledger.ts:519-527 spreads the field in only when isPendingAsBuiltRemediationFindings accepts it and otherwise silently omits it, after which the projection reader at src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:2375-2401 reads `ledger.pendingAsBuiltRemediationFindings ?? []` and loses a durable pending finding. The approved architecture already decided this behavior, so this is conforming implementation drift and routes to build, not to architecture_review. No active plan task admits the repair: Task 7's Done-when is scoped to gate-entry fields (adjustments, effectiveLimit, round-trip, credit preservation), Task 8 to lease routing, and Task rem-as-built-rem-adr0831-1 to adr-2026-08-31 decision 1's envelope/version/read-error and gate-entry class — none names the ledger-level pending-remediation field or adr-2026-08-25 decision 7 (88%, verified by reading each Done-when block). Sibling sites of the same silently-omit-a-malformed-field shape found in parseKickbackLedger: `growth` at kickback-ledger.ts:518 is excluded here because it is AB-1's evidence and is owned by the bound existing task; `settlementReceipts` at kickback-ledger.ts:521-524 is found and excluded because no cited ADR clause and no active plan task's Done-when admits changing it — it is recorded here rather than quietly fixed. No coverage is removed: the parser must keep the gate-scoped diagnostics Task 7 delivered (malformed adjustments render unavailable; a malformed effectiveLimit invalidates only its gate; sibling gates keep their counts) and must not convert those gate-scoped cases into whole-ledger rejection.
**Governing clause:** adr-2026-08-25-as-built-remediable-findings-bounded-build-route decision 7

### Task rem-as-built-rem-as-built-rem-ab1-1: src/conductor/src/engine/closeout-events.ts:34-49 — serialize the kickback_budget_adjustment_authorized external append per the carried-forward writer-lock clause of adr-2026-08-29-kickback-budget-recovery-uses-needs-human-halt-class D4: hold one exclusive writer lock (createConductStateLease from src/conductor/src/engine/conduct-state-lease.ts:148, label distinct from 'kickback-ledger' and keyed on the pipeline-events.jsonl path) across the whole existsSync/readFileSync idempotency check and the appendFileSync so a concurrent second command cannot observe the adjustment id as absent, expose it as an async locked path invoked from appendAuthorizationEvent at src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-budget-cli.ts:54-57 while leaving the synchronous unlocked append used by closeout-cli.ts:46, task-cli.ts:358 and build-review-cli.ts:252,325,357,426,448 behaviorally unchanged, bring the matched counterpart along in this same change by reading pipeline-events.jsonl under that same lock in reconcilePendingAdjustments at src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-budget-cli.ts:67-87 so writer and reconciler cannot observe divergent state, surface a lock-acquisition failure as the existing 'kickback-budget: refused' non-zero path with the pending record retained and active budget fields unchanged, and add a closeout-events test proving two concurrent authorized appends of one adjustment id yield exactly one line while distinct ids yield two — preserving unchanged the coverage Task 13 delivered (exactly one history record and one sibling-ledger event, unchanged sibling gates/growth/count/mechanical fields, refusal on held lease or generation mismatch), the coverage Task 14 delivered (pending record with no event discarded, with an event applied once, unreadable event ledger refuses and retains), and the existing assertions in src/conductor/test/closeout-events.test.ts and src/conductor/test/closeout-event.test.ts for the non-kickback event types
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** REMEDIABLE ADR-conformance defect, not a design question (99%, verified from current source and the governing ADRs): APPROVED adr-2026-08-29-kickback-budget-recovery-uses-needs-human-halt-class D4 carries forward D5's requirement that the external authorization event writer combine a writer lock with the idempotency check, but src/conductor/src/engine/closeout-events.ts:34-49 performs an unlocked existsSync -> readFileSync -> appendFileSync, and the kickback-ledger lease that staged the adjustment has already been released before the append at src/conductor/src/engine/kickback-budget-cli.ts:159-187, so two concurrent operator commands can both see the adjustment id as absent and both append it. The approved architecture stands and prescribes the remedy verbatim, so adr-2026-08-25's bounded build route applies rather than architecture_review or a halt. No existing active-plan task Done-when admits the repair: Task 13 requires 'exactly one sibling-ledger event' only for the sequential mutation path and its refusal check names the ledger lease, and Task 14 covers crash-window reconciliation by adjustment id, not concurrent writers -- so this is appended work, not existing-task. Class sweep: the matched counterpart is the reconciliation reader of the same file at kickback-budget-cli.ts:67-87, which must observe the same serialized state, and it is brought along in the same task. Found and deliberately excluded: the three other appendCloseoutEvent callers (closeout-cli.ts:46, task-cli.ts:358, build-review-cli.ts:252-448) append to pipeline-events.jsonl through the same function but carry no exactly-once ADR obligation and no idempotency check, so serializing them is not admitted by any plan task and is not attempted; the task must leave their append behavior byte-identical. The three diagram inaccuracies in Drift Notes are non-blocking and are not remediated here.
