## Summary

Move metric ownership from per-dispatch visualizers to one daemon-lifetime meter, re-key metric
identity to project/worker, and add the daemon-level and per-feature instruments that make
backlog, halts, gates, and end-to-end duration chartable — with every metric derived from typed
events by one listener, so the design holds when dispatch moves to a service with remote workers.
21 tasks.

## Technical Approach

- **One meter per daemon, fed by events (adr-014 D7).** `wireDaemonOtel(config, ctx, rootEvents)`
  in `src/conductor/src/engine/otel/wire.ts` builds the `MeterProvider` + `MetricsRecorder` once at
  daemon start, attaches a `MetricsListener` (`otel/metrics-listener.ts`) to the root bus, and
  returns `{ stop }`. The listener is the **only** metric recorder: it derives the existing
  per-feature instruments from forwarded `step_started`/`step_completed`/`step_failed`/`step_retry`
  (duration from event timestamps, retries from retry events, dispatch metering from the completed
  event's token usage), the cost gauges from `feature_cost_snapshot`/`feature_usage_total`, closeout
  from `pipeline_closeout`, `run.outcomes` from `feature_complete`/`loop_halt`/`feature_dispatch_ended`,
  and the new daemon-level and feature instruments from the new events. `beginFeatureRun` passes
  `metrics: false` into `wireOtelVisualizer`; `OtelVisualizer` then builds only its `TracerProvider`
  and its `SpanManager` metric callbacks are no-ops. The interactive `index.ts` path constructs a
  `MetricsListener` with its own meter on the run bus beside the visualizer, so there is one
  recording code path and the interactive instrument set is byte-identical to today.
- **Identity (D8).** `buildResource(ctx, 'metrics')` emits `service.instance.id=<project>/<worker>`,
  `conductor.project`, `conductor.worker`, `host.name`; `conductor.feature`/`conductor.branch` stay on
  the trace Resource only. `MetricsRecorder` gains a per-process identity (`project`, `worker`) and a
  per-feature identity applied only by the per-feature record methods; daemon-level record methods
  attach no `feature`. `worker` resolves from `otel.worker_name` (trimmed, non-blank) else
  `os.hostname()` else `unknown`, mirroring the `otel.project_name` chain in `otel-config.ts`.
- **Spine (D9).** Three new `ConductorEvent` variants with closed-union payloads:
  `daemon_backlog_snapshot`, `feature_dispatch_started`, `feature_dispatch_ended`, `feature_shipped`. The daemon root bus gets
  an `EventPersister` writing `<mainRoot>/.daemon/events.jsonl` that skips events tagged by the
  existing `forwardedFromFeature` WeakSet. A `MetricsListener` (`otel/daemon-metrics-listener.ts`)
  subscribes to `otelEventTypes()` on whichever bus it is given. Every per-feature event already
  reaches the root bus via `ForwardingEventEmitter`; a `WeakMap` beside the existing
  `forwardedFromFeature` `WeakSet` tags each forwarded copy with its slug (`forwardedFeatureOf`).
- **Daemon loop seam.** `DaemonDeps` gains `onTick?(snapshot)`; the loop in `daemon.ts` calls it
  once per discovery pass with counts it already computed (items/waiting/blocked/gated come from the
  discovery hook layer where they are visible today — follow the `onGatedDiscovered` precedent in
  `daemon-work-source.ts` and its wiring in `daemon-cli.ts`), plus `claims.listParked()`,
  `inFlight.size`, `concurrency`, the four dispatch-blocking flags, and the pass duration. Eligibility
  age uses a `.daemon/first-seen/<slug>` marker written on first discovery (durable state, not an
  occurrence; same shape as `.daemon/parked/`).
- **Halt class source.** At dispatch end the daemon reads the worktree's `HALT.class` through a new
  `readHaltSidecarClassification()` that recognizes the eight sidecar values (the six
  `HaltDisposition` values plus `kickback-cap` and `over-scope`). `readHaltClass` and re-kick
  behavior are untouched.
- **Durations.** `feature_shipped` carries `runStartedAt` (from `readState` of the worktree's
  `conduct-state.json`) and the timing rollup's `{ state, activeMs }`; the listener records
  `duration.wall` only when `runStartedAt` is present and `duration.active` only when `state==='exact'`.
- **Local pattern basis.** The daemon-level listener follows `AuditTrailWriter`: constructed once
  near the bus, subscribed by a registry-derived type list, handlers never throw, detached on stop
  (search hints: `AuditTrailWriter`, `auditedEventTypes`, `startFeatureEventPersistence`). Allowed
  variation: it holds a recorder, not a writer. Tests follow the existing in-memory-exporter shape
  (search hints: `InMemoryMetricExporter`, `findMetric`, `daemon-otel-wiring.test.ts`,
  `daemon-otel-parity.acceptance.test.ts`); Resource assertions read the exported Resource, never
  data-point attributes.
- **Sequencing.** Spine + config + identity first (1–5), spans-only visualizer and daemon wiring
  (6–7), forwarded-slug tagging and the listener's per-feature instruments (17, 20, 21), the
  monotonic acceptance (8), the tick seam and daemon-level gauges (9–12), feature lifecycle counters
  (13–16), gate counters (18), interactive parity last (19).

## Prerequisites

- None external. `@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics` 2.10 already supports multiple recorders on one meter
  (verified 2026-09-06).

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add the four daemon-level event variants and their sink rows
**Story:** Story 7 (registry rows; missing-row compile failure)
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: `otelEventTypes()` and `persistedEventTypes()` both include `daemon_backlog_snapshot`, `feature_dispatch_started`, `feature_dispatch_ended`, `feature_shipped`; a type-level test (`// @ts-expect-error`) proves omitting a row for a union member fails compilation
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: add the four variants to `src/conductor/src/types/events.ts` with closed unions `BacklogState = 'eligible'|'waiting'|'blocked'|'gated'|'parked'`, `DispatchKind = 'initial'|'resume'|'rekick'`, `DispatchBlockReason = 'paused'|'build_auth_missing'|'gh_version'|'episode_active'`, and payloads: snapshot `{ counts: Record<BacklogState, number>, oldestAgeSeconds: Partial<Record<BacklogState, number>>, slots: { busy: number; free: number }, inFlight: string[], blocked: Record<DispatchBlockReason, boolean>, pollDurationMs: number }`; dispatch `{ slug: string; kind: DispatchKind }`; ended `{ slug: string; outcome: 'complete'|'halted'|'terminated' }`; shipped `{ slug: string; runStartedAt?: number; active: { state: 'exact'|'partial'|'unavailable'; activeMs?: number } }`; add `EVENT_SINKS` rows `{ render: false, persist: true, audit: false, otel: true }`
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Add daemon_backlog_snapshot, feature_dispatch_started, feature_dispatch_ended, feature_shipped events with sink rows"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts `otelEventTypes()` and `persistedEventTypes()` each contain the four new type names
- A `@ts-expect-error` fixture proves a union member without an EVENT_SINKS row fails compilation
- The three payload types use only closed string unions for state, kind, and reason fields (no `string`)
- Existing `event-sink-registry.test.ts` and `otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts` still pass

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/types/events.ts — three variants and closed unions
- src/conductor/src/engine/event-sinks.ts — three rows
- src/conductor/test/event-sinks.test.ts — derivation and compile-failure fixture

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 2: Persist daemon-bus events to the daemon ledger, skipping forwarded copies
**Story:** Story 7 (daemon ledger persistence; forwarded events written once; unwritable ledger)
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: with a root bus and a feature `ForwardingEventEmitter`, emitting `daemon_backlog_snapshot` on the root bus appends one line to `<mainRoot>/.daemon/events.jsonl`; emitting `gate_verdict` on the feature bus appends one line to the feature `.pipeline/events.jsonl` and zero lines to the daemon ledger; an unwritable `.daemon/` directory logs one failure line and the emit does not throw
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: `startDaemonEventPersistence(mainRoot, rootEvents, log)` in `src/conductor/src/engine/event-persister.ts` that attaches an `EventPersister` to the root bus for `persistedEventTypes()` and returns early for events where `isForwardedFromFeature(event)` is true; wire it in `daemon-cli.ts` at daemon start and stop it at shutdown
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Persist daemon-bus events to .daemon/events.jsonl, skipping forwarded feature events"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts a root-bus snapshot event appears exactly once in `.daemon/events.jsonl` in the same JSON schema as `.pipeline/events.jsonl`
- A test asserts a forwarded gate_verdict appears once in the feature ledger and zero times in the daemon ledger
- A test with an unwritable `.daemon/` asserts one logged failure line, no throw, and the emitter still delivers the event to other subscribers
- `daemon-cli.ts` starts the daemon persister before the loop and stops it in the existing shutdown path

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/event-persister.ts — startDaemonEventPersistence
- src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts — wire at start/stop
- src/conductor/test/daemon-event-persistence.test.ts — new

**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Task 3: Resolve otel.worker_name with hostname fallback and register the config key
**Story:** Story 2 (worker_name set/blank/absent; hostname failure fallback)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: `resolveOtelConfig` yields `workerName` = trimmed value when `otel.worker_name` is non-blank, `undefined` when blank or absent; `resolveWorkerName(resolved)` returns the config value, else `os.hostname()`, else `unknown` when hostname throws or is empty; `config-consumer-registry.test.ts` passes with `otel.worker_name` in `CONFIG_CONSUMER_KEY_SETS.otel` and a declared consumer; the scaffolder template lists the key
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: add `worker_name?: string` under the `otel` block in `src/conductor/src/types/config.ts`; thread through `resolveOtelConfig` → `ResolvedOtelConfig.workerName` exactly as `projectName`; add `resolveWorkerName` in `otel-config.ts`; add `worker_name` to `CONFIG_CONSUMER_KEY_SETS.otel` in `src/conductor/src/engine/config.ts` and the matching consumer entry in the registry test's declaration table; add a commented `worker_name` line to `templates/project-config.yml.template`
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Add otel.worker_name with hostname fallback and registry/template entries"

**Done when:**
- Tests cover `otel.worker_name` set, blank, absent, and an `os.hostname()` that throws, asserting the resolved worker is the trimmed value, the hostname, the hostname, and `unknown` respectively
- `config-consumer-registry.test.ts` passes with `otel.worker_name` present in `CONFIG_CONSUMER_KEY_SETS.otel` and a declared consumer (`otel-config.ts`)
- `templates/project-config.yml.template` contains a commented `worker_name` line under `otel:`
- `resolveOtelConfig` never throws for any `otel.worker_name` value (existing never-fails tests still pass)

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/types/config.ts — worker_name
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-config.ts — workerName, resolveWorkerName
- src/conductor/src/engine/config.ts — CONFIG_CONSUMER_KEY_SETS.otel gains worker_name
- src/conductor/test/engine/config-consumer-registry.ts — consumer declaration
- templates/project-config.yml.template — commented key
- src/conductor/test/otel-config.test.ts — cases

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 4: Re-key the metric Resource to project/worker and keep the trace Resource feature-scoped
**Story:** Story 2 (metric Resource shape; no conductor.feature on it; trace Resource unchanged)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: `buildResource(ctx, 'metrics')` attribute set is exactly `{ service.name: 'ai-conductor', service.instance.id: 'P/W', conductor.project, conductor.worker: 'W', host.name }` with no `conductor.feature`, `conductor.branch`, `conductor.run.id`; `buildResource(ctx, 'traces')` still carries `conductor.feature`, `conductor.branch`, `conductor.run.id`, `conductor.engine.version` and the same `service.instance.id`
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: add `workerName` to the resource context; compose the metric-signal attribute set as above and the trace-signal set as today plus `conductor.worker`; keep `unknown` fallbacks for absent project or worker
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Metric Resource is worker-stable: service.instance.id=project/worker, feature only on traces"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts the exported metric Resource's exact key set and `service.instance.id === 'P/W'` and `host.name` present
- A test asserts `conductor.feature` and `conductor.branch` are absent from the metric Resource and present on the trace Resource
- A test asserts an absent worker yields `service.instance.id` ending in `/unknown` with no throw
- Existing resource tests for `service.name` constancy and run-id placement still pass

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/resource.ts — signal-scoped attribute sets
- src/conductor/test/otel-resource.test.ts — exact-set assertions

**Dependencies:** Task 3

### Task 5: MetricsRecorder carries project/worker on every point and feature only on per-feature instruments
**Story:** Story 2 (per-feature points carry project, worker, feature; daemon-level points carry no feature)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: with one recorder constructed for `{ project: 'P', worker: 'W' }`, `forFeature('S').onStepClose(...)` yields a `conductor.step.duration` point with attributes `{ project: 'P', worker: 'W', feature: 'S', step }`; `onDaemonBacklog(...)` yields `conductor.daemon.backlog` points with `{ project, worker, state }` and no `feature` key
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: constructor takes `{ project, worker }`; add `forFeature(feature)` returning a bound per-feature view over the same instruments (identity merged per call, no new instruments); add daemon-level instruments `conductor.daemon.backlog`, `conductor.daemon.backlog.oldest_age` (unit s), `conductor.daemon.slots`, `conductor.daemon.inflight`, `conductor.daemon.up`, `conductor.daemon.blocked_reason`, `conductor.daemon.poll.duration` (ms histogram, existing boundaries), `conductor.daemon.stalls`, and per-feature `conductor.feature.dispatches`, `conductor.feature.halts`, `conductor.feature.shipped`, `conductor.feature.duration.wall`, `conductor.feature.duration.active` (ms histograms), `conductor.gate.verdicts`, `conductor.gate.kickbacks`, with record methods for each; update the two existing construction sites to the new constructor
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "MetricsRecorder: process identity plus per-feature view; add daemon and feature instruments"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts a per-feature data point carries exactly `project`, `worker`, `feature` plus the instrument's own attributes
- A test asserts a daemon-level data point carries `project` and `worker` and has no `feature` key
- All fifteen new instrument names are created once per recorder (a second `forFeature` view creates no new instruments — asserted by instrument count on the exporter)
- Existing metrics tests pass with the new constructor signature

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts — identity split and new instruments
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts — construction site
- src/conductor/test/otel-metrics.test.ts — attribute assertions

**Dependencies:** Task 3

### Task 6: OtelVisualizer runs spans-only when told to, and owns its meter otherwise
**Story:** Story 1 (visualizer holds no meter under the daemon); Story 8 (interactive visualizer initializes without the flag)
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: (a) a visualizer constructed with `metrics: false` in its context creates no `MeterProvider` and no `MetricsRecorder`, its `SpanManager` still opens and closes spans, and `stop()` shuts down its owned `TracerProvider` exactly once after exporting force-closed spans while never touching a meter; (b) a visualizer constructed without the flag creates its own `TracerProvider` only when a `MetricsListener` is not also supplied — the meter now lives in the listener (Task 20) — and initializes without throwing
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: add optional `metrics?: boolean` (default true for compatibility during the refactor; Task 19 flips the interactive path to the listener) to `OtelVisualizerContext` and `VisualizerFactoryContext`; in `initializeProviders` skip the meter/recorder branch when false and make the `SpanManagerCallbacks` metric hooks no-ops; `_doStop` shuts down the owned tracer through the bounded failure-isolation path (without a preceding `forceFlush()`, because OTel shutdown includes it) and guards the meter shutdown on `this.meterProvider` being non-null; forward the field in `plugin-loader.ts`'s `visualizer:otel` factory and in `createOtelVisualizer`
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "OtelVisualizer: spans-only mode constructs no MeterProvider"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts a `metrics: false` visualizer constructs no `MeterProvider` and `stop()` calls no meter method while its owned `TracerProvider` is shut down exactly once
- A test asserts a visualizer constructed with no `metrics` flag initializes without throwing and exports force-closed spans before tracer shutdown
- Both modes own a per-run `TracerProvider`; stop bounds and failure-isolates its one shutdown call

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts — metrics flag, no-op metric callbacks, guarded shutdown
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/create-otel-visualizer.ts — pass-through
- src/conductor/src/engine/plugin-loader.ts — factory pass-through
- src/conductor/src/types/plugin.ts — VisualizerFactoryContext field
- src/conductor/test/otel-visualizer-spans-only.test.ts — new

**Dependencies:** Task 5

### Task 7: Wire the daemon-owned meter and listener at daemon start; dispatches are spans-only
**Story:** Story 1 (exactly one MeterProvider for the daemon's life; disabled config leaves the daemon unchanged)
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: with OTel enabled, the daemon start path calls `wireDaemonOtel` once, which constructs one `MeterProvider`, one `MetricsRecorder`, and one `MetricsListener` subscribed to the root bus; every `beginFeatureRun` wires its visualizer with `metrics: false`; with OTel disabled or absent, `wireDaemonOtel` returns `null`, no `MeterProvider` is constructed, and the per-dispatch wiring is unchanged from today
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: `wireDaemonOtel(config, { mainRoot, projectName, workerName, rootEvents })` in `src/conductor/src/engine/otel/wire.ts` building the metric Resource (Task 4), `PeriodicExportingMetricReader`, `MeterProvider`, `MetricsRecorder` (Task 5), and a `MetricsListener` stub (Task 20 fills its handlers) attached to `rootEvents`, returning `{ stop }` where `stop` detaches the listener, force-flushes, and shuts down; call it in `daemon-cli.ts` before the loop and await `stop` in the shutdown path; in `beginFeatureRun` pass `metrics: false` into `wireOtelVisualizer`'s context
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Daemon owns one MeterProvider and one MetricsListener; dispatch visualizers are spans-only"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts one `MeterProvider` and one `MetricsListener` are constructed per daemon start and two dispatches each wire a `metrics: false` visualizer
- A test asserts disabled or absent OTel config constructs no `MeterProvider` and leaves per-dispatch wiring unchanged
- A test asserts daemon shutdown detaches the listener, then calls `forceFlush()` and `shutdown()` on the daemon provider exactly once each
- `daemon-otel-wiring.test.ts` and `daemon-otel-parity.acceptance.test.ts` still pass

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/wire.ts — wireDaemonOtel
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — new (class skeleton, subscribe/detach)
- src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts — start/stop wiring, beginFeatureRun flag
- src/conductor/test/daemon-otel-wiring.test.ts — daemon-meter cases

**Dependencies:** Task 4, Task 6

### Task 8: Counters accumulate across re-dispatches under one daemon
**Story:** Story 1 (run.outcomes halted reads 2; step.retries monotonic; daemon restart is a single reset)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test (acceptance, in-memory exporter, fake feature runs): one daemon dispatches feature S which halts, re-dispatches S which halts again — `conductor.run.outcomes{feature=S, outcome=halted}` reads 2 after the second dispatch and never reads a value lower than a previous export; two dispatches each retrying `build` once give `conductor.step.retries{feature=S, step=build}` = 2; a second daemon process (new `wireDaemonOtel`) exports the same series identity (`service.instance.id`, `project`, `worker`, `feature`) with a fresh counter
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: no production code expected beyond Tasks 5–7, 17, 20, 21; fix any identity or reset defect the test exposes
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Acceptance: per-feature counters are monotonic across dispatches under one daemon"

**Done when:**
- An acceptance test asserts `conductor.run.outcomes{outcome=halted}` for one feature reads 2 after two halting dispatches under one daemon
- The same test asserts `conductor.step.retries` for the feature is 2 after two single-retry dispatches
- A test asserts a second daemon instance exports the identical series identity attribute set with counters restarting from zero exactly once
- No duplicate-instrument warning is emitted across the two dispatches (asserted on captured warnings)
- A variant runs each dispatch through a child-process-shaped fake that emits its events and exits, and asserts the feature's counters continue from their prior values

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/test/acceptance/daemon-monotonic-counters.acceptance.test.ts — new

**Dependencies:** Task 7, Task 20, Task 21

### Task 9: Daemon loop reports a per-tick snapshot through a DaemonDeps hook
**Story:** Story 3 (counts per state; slots and in-flight; poll duration)
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: driving the daemon loop with a fake `discoverBacklog` and a `LocalWorkSource` that surfaces 3 eligible / 2 waiting / 1 blocked / 4 gated, two parked claims, concurrency 3 with two in-flight, the loop calls `deps.onTick` once per pass with `{ counts: { eligible: 3, waiting: 2, blocked: 1, gated: 4, parked: 2 }, slots: { busy: 2, free: 1 }, inFlight: [two slugs], blocked: { paused: false, build_auth_missing: false, gh_version: false, episode_active: false }, pollDurationMs: >0 }`
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: extend the discovery hook layer so `waiting` and `blocked` counts reach the wiring layer alongside `gated` (follow the `onGatedDiscovered` shape in `daemon-work-source.ts`); add `onTick?: (snapshot: DaemonTickSnapshot) => void` to `DaemonDeps`; in `daemon.ts` call it after `pickEligible` on both the idle and busy branches with the in-scope locals and the measured discovery duration; the hook is synchronous and does no I/O
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Daemon loop emits a per-tick backlog snapshot through DaemonDeps.onTick"

**Done when:**
- A loop test asserts `onTick` is called once per pass with the exact counts, slots, in-flight slugs, and flags above
- A test asserts `pollDurationMs` equals the measured discovery duration within 50 ms of a fake clock
- The hook is invoked on both the idle branch and the busy-pool branch (two tests, one per branch)
- A test asserts the hook performs no filesystem or git call (spied `fs`/`execFile` receive zero calls from inside `onTick`)

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/daemon.ts — onTick call sites
- src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-deps.ts — DaemonDeps.onTick, DaemonTickSnapshot
- src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-work-source.ts — surface waiting/blocked counts to the hook layer
- src/conductor/test/daemon-tick-snapshot.test.ts — new

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 10: Track first-seen time per spec for backlog age
**Story:** Story 3 (oldest eligible age; specs with no determinable timestamp are excluded from age but counted)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: on first discovery of slug S a `.daemon/first-seen/S` marker is written with the current epoch ms; a later discovery does not rewrite it; `oldestAgeSeconds(state)` returns now minus the oldest marker among that state's members; a member with no marker (unreadable or absent) is excluded from the age and still counted
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: `first-seen-marker.ts` with `recordFirstSeen(mainRoot, slug)` (write-if-absent, tmp+rename) and `readFirstSeen(mainRoot, slug)`; call `recordFirstSeen` from the discovery hook layer for every discovered slug; compute `oldestAgeSeconds` per state in the snapshot builder
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Record first-seen time per spec under .daemon/first-seen for backlog age"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts the marker is created once and not rewritten on repeat discovery
- A test asserts `oldestAgeSeconds.eligible` equals the age of the oldest eligible member's marker within 1 s
- A test asserts a member with an unreadable marker is excluded from the age while `counts.eligible` still includes it
- The marker write never throws (an unwritable `.daemon/` logs once and discovery proceeds)

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/first-seen-marker.ts — new
- src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-work-source.ts — record on discovery, compute ages
- src/conductor/test/first-seen-marker.test.ts — new

**Dependencies:** Task 9

### Task 11: Emit daemon_backlog_snapshot and record the daemon-level gauges
**Story:** Story 3 (backlog per state; oldest age; slots; inflight; poll duration; blocked_reason paused and build_auth_missing; empty state reads 0)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: `MetricsListener` subscribed to a root bus receives a `daemon_backlog_snapshot` and the exporter shows `conductor.daemon.backlog` with five points (3, 2, 1, 4, 2), `conductor.daemon.backlog.oldest_age{state=eligible}` ≈ 129600, `conductor.daemon.slots` busy=2 free=1, `conductor.daemon.inflight` = 1 for each in-flight slug, `conductor.daemon.poll.duration` one observation of 840, `conductor.daemon.blocked_reason` = 1 for `paused` and 0 for the other three, and `conductor.daemon.up` = 1; a snapshot with all-zero counts still yields five backlog points reading 0
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: in `src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts` (skeleton from Task 7, `AuditTrailWriter` shape: subscribe to `otelEventTypes()`, never throw, detach on stop) add a `daemon_backlog_snapshot` handler calling the Task 5 daemon-level record methods; in `daemon-cli.ts` the `onTick` hook emits `daemon_backlog_snapshot` on the root bus
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "MetricsListener records backlog, age, slots, inflight, blocked_reason, poll duration, and up"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts all five `conductor.daemon.backlog` states are present with the exact counts, and a zero-member state reads 0 rather than being absent
- A test asserts `oldest_age`, `slots`, `inflight`, `poll.duration`, and `up` data points match the snapshot payload
- A test asserts `blocked_reason` reads 1 for `paused` and 0 for `build_auth_missing`, `gh_version`, `episode_active`, and a second snapshot with `build_auth_missing` true flips those values
- `conductor.daemon.up` is a synchronous Gauge recorded once per snapshot, not an observable callback (asserted by instrument type on the exporter)

- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — new
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/wire.ts — construct/start/stop the listener

**Dependencies:** Task 1, Task 5, Task 7, Task 9, Task 10

### Task 12: An idle daemon exports liveness, backlog, and slot series
**Story:** Story 3 (idle daemon exports up, all five backlog states, slots; hard-kill lets up go stale)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test (acceptance): start the daemon loop with OTel enabled, an empty backlog, and no dispatch; after one tick and a forced export, the in-memory exporter holds `conductor.daemon.up` = 1, five `conductor.daemon.backlog` points reading 0, and `conductor.daemon.slots{busy=0, free=concurrency}`; stopping the loop and forcing one more export produces no new `up` observation
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: no production code expected beyond Tasks 9–11; fix whatever the idle path exposes
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Acceptance: an idle daemon exports up, backlog, and slots without a dispatch"

**Done when:**
- An acceptance test with no dispatch asserts `conductor.daemon.up` = 1, five backlog points reading 0, and both slot states are exported after one tick
- The same test asserts no `up` observation is recorded after the loop stops, so the series goes stale when the daemon dies
- The test runs against the real daemon loop entry (not the listener in isolation)

**Dependencies:** Task 11

### Task 13: Classify dispatch kind and count feature dispatches
**Story:** Story 4 (initial dispatch; rekick after HALT clear; resume of an existing un-halted worktree)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: dispatching a slug with no existing worktree emits `feature_dispatch_started{kind: 'initial'}`; dispatching a slug whose worktree exists and whose HALT was just cleared (the `.pipeline/REKICK` sentinel or a `HALT.cleared` cause present) emits `kind: 'rekick'`; dispatching a slug whose worktree exists with no halt-clear signal emits `kind: 'resume'`; the listener records `conductor.feature.dispatches{feature, kind}` = 1 for each
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: `createWorktree` (or the runner's call site) surfaces `wasExisting`; `classifyDispatchKind({ wasExisting, rekickSignal })` returns the closed union; `daemon-runner.ts` emits `feature_dispatch_started` on the root bus at the dispatch site; `MetricsListener` handles it
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Emit feature_dispatch_started with initial/resume/rekick and count feature.dispatches"

**Done when:**
- Tests assert `kind` is `initial`, `rekick`, and `resume` for the three fixtures above
- A test asserts `conductor.feature.dispatches{feature=S, kind}` increments by 1 per dispatch and carries `project`, `worker`, `feature`
- `feature_dispatch_started` is emitted from the daemon dispatch path (asserted on the root bus in a runner test), not from inside the conductor

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/worktree.ts — wasExisting
- src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-runner.ts — classify and emit

### Task 14: Count halts by sidecar classification and halting step
**Story:** Story 4 (halt with needs-human at build_review; missing/unreadable/unknown sidecar; legacy; kickback-cap and over-scope verbatim; record write failure still counts)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: `readHaltSidecarClassification(worktree)` returns each of the eight values for a sidecar holding it, `legacy` for a pre-sidecar HALT (HALT present, no HALT.class, legacy marker semantics as `readHaltClass` defines), and `unclassified` for missing, unreadable, or unknown content; at dispatch end for a halted feature the daemon emits the halt classification alongside the `loop_halt` step onto the root bus and `conductor.feature.halts{feature=S, haltClass, step=build_review}` reads 1; when `halt_record_written` fails but `loop_halt` was emitted, the counter still increments

> **Amended 2026-09-08 by #1937:** When `HALT` exists, an absent `HALT.class` is `legacy`; `unclassified` applies when the sidecar is unreadable or contains an unrecognized value. The pre-sidecar and deleted-sidecar histories are indistinguishable on disk, so this feature preserves legacy reporting without adding a timestamp, migration marker, or parallel telemetry channel.

2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: `readHaltSidecarClassification` in `halt-marker.ts` (a sibling of `readHaltClass`; `readHaltClass` and re-kick behavior unchanged); in `daemon-runner.ts` at the halted-dispatch end read the classification and emit it on the root bus as an additive optional `sidecarClass` field on the forwarded `loop_halt` (or a daemon-side wrapper event carrying `{ slug, haltClass, step }`); listener records `conductor.feature.halts`
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Count feature halts by the eight sidecar classification values and halting step"

**Done when:**
- A test covers all eight sidecar values on `conductor.feature.halts`, plus `legacy` and `unclassified` derivations, with no free-text value possible (closed union asserted by type test)
- A test asserts `kickback-cap` and `over-scope` are recorded verbatim, not folded to `unclassified`
- A test asserts a halt still increments the counter when the halt-record write fails
- `readHaltClass` behavior and the re-kick sweep tests are unchanged

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/halt-marker.ts — readHaltSidecarClassification
- src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-runner.ts — read and emit at halted dispatch end

**Dependencies:** Task 11

### Task 15: Emit feature_shipped and count ships; parked features count as neither
**Story:** Story 4 (ship increments feature.shipped; parked feature increments neither halts nor shipped)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: on the daemon's happy-ship branch the root bus receives `feature_shipped{ slug: S, runStartedAt, active }` where `runStartedAt` comes from `readState` of the worktree's `conduct-state.json` and `active` from `computeTimingRollup`; `conductor.feature.shipped{feature=S}` reads 1; an operator-parked feature appears in `backlog{state=parked}` and increments neither `feature.halts` nor `feature.shipped`
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: in `daemon-runner.ts`'s ship branch (worktree still present) read state and rollup, emit `feature_shipped` on the root bus; listener records `conductor.feature.shipped`
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Emit feature_shipped with run start and active rollup; count feature.shipped"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts `feature_shipped` is emitted on the root bus with `runStartedAt` equal to the worktree state's `run_started_at` and `active.state` equal to the rollup state
- A test asserts `conductor.feature.shipped{feature=S}` reads 1 after the ship branch
- A test asserts a parked feature is present in `conductor.daemon.backlog{state=parked}` and absent from `feature.halts` and `feature.shipped`

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-runner.ts — ship-branch emission
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — handler
- src/conductor/test/daemon-feature-shipped.test.ts — new

**Dependencies:** Task 11

### Task 16: Record wall and active feature durations with absence-not-zero
**Story:** Story 6 (wall from first dispatch to ship; active from exact rollup; wall exceeds active across a halt; partial/unavailable omits active; missing run_started_at omits wall; halt records neither)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: a `feature_shipped` with `runStartedAt=T0` at ship time `T1` and `active={state:'exact', activeMs:A}` yields one `conductor.feature.duration.wall{feature=S}` observation of `T1-T0` and one `conductor.feature.duration.active` observation of `A`; with `active.state='partial'` the active histogram has no observation and wall still has one; with `runStartedAt` absent the wall histogram has no observation and `feature.shipped` still increments; a halted terminal yields no observation on either
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: listener's `feature_shipped` handler records wall only when `runStartedAt` is a finite number and active only when `state==='exact'`; halts never touch the duration histograms
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Record feature.duration.wall and .active; omit, never fabricate, on partial or missing data"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts one wall observation equal to ship time minus `runStartedAt` and one active observation equal to `activeMs` for an exact rollup
- A test asserts a partial rollup yields zero active observations (count 0, not a 0-valued point) while wall is recorded
- A test asserts a missing `runStartedAt` yields zero wall observations while `feature.shipped` increments
- A test asserts a halted terminal leaves both histograms with zero observations
- A test with a two-day gap between dispatches asserts wall minus active is at least 172800000 ms

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — duration handling
- src/conductor/test/feature-duration-metrics.test.ts — new

**Dependencies:** Task 15

### Task 17: Forwarded per-feature events carry their slug and are counted once
**Story:** Story 5 (forwarded verdict counted once); Story 7 (forwarded step_completed attributed to its feature; forwarded event persisted once, in the feature ledger only)
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: with a feature `ForwardingEventEmitter` for slug S attached to the root bus, emitting one `gate_verdict` on the feature bus delivers one forwarded copy to the root bus for which `forwardedFeatureOf(copy) === 'S'`; a listener on the root bus records exactly one `conductor.gate.verdicts` point with `feature=S` and value 1; a `step_completed` forwarded the same way yields one `conductor.step.duration` point with `feature=S`; a non-forwarded root-bus event has `forwardedFeatureOf === undefined`
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: `ForwardingEventEmitter` takes the slug at construction (`startFeatureEventPersistence` already knows it) and records `forwardedFeature.set(copy, slug)` in a `WeakMap` beside the existing `WeakSet`; export `forwardedFeatureOf(event)`; the listener's per-feature handlers take the feature from `forwardedFeatureOf` and skip events with no slug for per-feature instruments
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Tag forwarded feature events with their slug; listener attributes and counts each once"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts one feature-bus `gate_verdict` yields exactly one `conductor.gate.verdicts` point with value 1 and `feature=S`
- A test asserts a forwarded `step_completed` yields one `conductor.step.duration` point with `feature=S`
- A test asserts `forwardedFeatureOf` is `undefined` for a root-bus-originated event and the listener records no per-feature point for it
- The Task 2 ledger test still shows the forwarded event once in the feature ledger and never in the daemon ledger

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/event-persister.ts — WeakMap tag, forwardedFeatureOf, slug parameter
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — feature attribution helper

**Dependencies:** Task 7

### Task 18: Count gate verdicts, kickbacks, and stalls
**Story:** Story 5 (pass; fail plus kickback routing; stall by reason; unknown step name verbatim; three fails read 3)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: a forwarded `gate_verdict{step:'build_review', satisfied:true}` yields `conductor.gate.verdicts{feature=S, step=build_review, outcome=pass}` = 1; `satisfied:false` plus `kickback{from:'build_review', to:'build'}` yields `outcome=fail` = 1 and `conductor.gate.kickbacks{feature=S, from=build_review, to=build}` = 1; `build_stall{reason:'no_task_progress'}` yields `conductor.daemon.stalls{reason=no_task_progress}` = 1 with no `feature` attribute; a verdict with step `some_future_step` records that step name verbatim without error; three consecutive fails read 3
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: listener handlers for `gate_verdict`, `kickback`, `build_stall` calling the Task 5 record methods with the feature taken from the forwarded event's feature tag
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Count gate.verdicts, gate.kickbacks, and daemon.stalls from forwarded events"

**Done when:**
- Tests assert the exact attribute sets and values for pass, fail-plus-kickback, and stall above
- A test asserts an unknown step name is carried verbatim on the `step` attribute with no thrown error
- A test asserts three fails for one gate in one dispatch read `outcome=fail` = 3

**Dependencies:** Task 17

### Task 19: Interactive path uses the listener with its own meter; listener coverage is enforced
**Story:** Story 7 (sink row with otel true but no listener handler fails the coverage test); Story 8 (interactive path: visualizer owns traces, listener owns an interactive meter, unchanged instrument set, shutdown once)
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: the listener coverage test names any `otel: true` event type with no `MetricsListener` handler case (fails for the four new types until their cases exist and for any type the visualizer used to record); an interactive run exports the pre-change instrument set with unchanged names and attributes, its metric Resource carries `service.instance.id = P/W`, per-feature points carry `feature`, and both the visualizer's tracer and the interactive listener's meter receive `shutdown()` exactly once on stop; a visualizer initialized without the `metrics` flag does not throw
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: in `index.ts`'s interactive wiring construct a `MetricsListener` with an interactive-owned `MeterProvider` on the run bus beside the visualizer (now `metrics: false` there too, so the visualizer never records metrics anywhere); remove the metric branches from `otel-visualizer.ts`'s `handleEvent` (spans only) and delete the now-dead recorder construction; rewrite `otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts`'s handler-coverage assertion to target the listener's handler table
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Interactive path records metrics through MetricsListener; visualizer is spans-only everywhere"

**Done when:**
- The listener coverage test names any `otel: true` event type lacking a `MetricsListener` handler and passes with every case present
- A test asserts the interactive exported instrument set (names, units, attribute keys) equals the pre-change set and the metric Resource is `P/W` with `feature` on per-feature points
- A test asserts the interactive visualizer's tracer and the interactive listener's meter each receive `shutdown()` exactly once on stop, and a visualizer without the `metrics` flag initializes without throwing
- `interactive-otel-wiring.test.ts` passes with its assertions retargeted from the visualizer's meter to the listener's meter

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/index.ts — interactive listener wiring
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts — remove metric branches
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts — coverage retargeted to the listener

**Dependencies:** Task 6, Task 11, Task 20, Task 21

### Task 20: Listener derives the existing step and cost instruments from forwarded events
**Story:** Story 7 (forwarded step_completed yields step.duration with the pre-change name, unit, attribute keys; parity within 5 ms)
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: driving one fake feature run's event stream (`step_started` at t0, `step_retry`, `step_completed` at t1 with token usage and model, `feature_cost_snapshot`, `feature_usage_total`, `pipeline_closeout`) through a root-bus `MetricsListener` yields `conductor.step.duration{feature,step}` = t1−t0, `conductor.step.retries` = retry count, `conductor.step.dispatches{step, metering}` = 1, the three cost/token gauges and the closeout histogram with the same names, units, and attribute keys as `MetricsRecorder` records today; a parity test runs the same stream through the pre-change visualizer path and asserts the two instrument sets are equal and durations agree within 5 ms
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: listener handlers for `step_started` (remember start per feature+step), `step_retry` (count), `step_completed`/`step_failed` (record duration, retries, dispatch metering via `classifyMetering`, clear state), `feature_cost_snapshot`, `feature_usage_total`, `pipeline_closeout`, delegating to the Task 5 recorder's per-feature methods; per-feature state is keyed by `forwardedFeatureOf(event)` (Task 17) and dropped at `feature_dispatch_ended`
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "MetricsListener derives step duration, retries, dispatches, cost, and closeout from events"

**Done when:**
- A test asserts `conductor.step.duration`, `conductor.step.retries`, `conductor.step.dispatches`, the three cost/token gauges, and `conductor.pipeline.closeout.duration` are recorded from a forwarded event stream with the pre-change names, units, and attribute keys
- A parity test asserts the listener-recorded and pre-change visualizer-recorded instrument sets are equal and each step duration agrees within 5 ms
- A test asserts per-feature start state is dropped after `feature_dispatch_ended` (a later `step_completed` with no matching start records no duration and no throw)

- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — step/cost handlers

**Dependencies:** Task 17

### Task 21: Listener records run outcomes from terminal events, including dispatch end
**Story:** Story 1 (run.outcomes halted reads 2 across dispatches); Story 7 (feature_dispatch_ended emitted and persisted)
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: a forwarded `feature_complete` yields `conductor.run.outcomes{feature=S, outcome=complete}` += 1; a forwarded `loop_halt` yields `outcome=halted` += 1; a `feature_dispatch_ended{outcome:'terminated'}` with no preceding terminal yields `outcome=terminated` += 1, while one that follows a `feature_complete` or `loop_halt` for the same dispatch records nothing further (one outcome per dispatch); `daemon-runner.ts` emits `feature_dispatch_ended` on the root bus when a dispatch returns with the observed outcome
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: listener terminal handlers with a per-feature "terminal seen" flag cleared at `feature_dispatch_started`; `daemon-runner.ts` emits `feature_dispatch_ended` at the dispatch-return site with `complete`, `halted`, or `terminated`
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Record run.outcomes from feature_complete, loop_halt, and feature_dispatch_ended, once per dispatch"

**Done when:**
- Tests assert `run.outcomes` increments once for `complete`, `halted`, and `terminated` from their events, and a `feature_dispatch_ended` after a terminal for the same dispatch records nothing further
- A runner test asserts `feature_dispatch_ended` is emitted on the root bus with the observed outcome when a dispatch returns
- The Task 2 ledger test shows `feature_dispatch_ended` persisted once in the daemon ledger

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — terminal handlers

## Integration Points

- After Task 20: a daemon with OTel enabled exports the existing instruments through one event-fed meter; per-dispatch visualizers export spans only.
- After Task 12: an idle daemon exports `up`, `backlog`, `slots` — the first end-to-end proof of the issue's "no dispatch required" outcome.
- After Task 18: every intake outcome is exportable; the Grafana halt/retry panels read true counts with no query change.

## Coverage Check

| Criterion | Task id(s) | Done when quote | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Story 1 happy: Given OTel is enabled and one daemon process dispatches feature S, which halts, is re-kicked, and halts again, when metrics are exported after the second dispatch, then conductor.run.outcomes{feature=S, outcome=halted} reads 2 and never reads 1 in between | 8 | "reads 2 after two halting dispatches under one daemon" | diff-local |
| Story 1 happy: Given one daemon process dispatches feature S twice and each dispatch retries the build step once, when metrics are exported after the second dispatch, then conductor.step.retries{feature=S, step=build} reads 2, monotonic across both dispatches | 8 | "`conductor.step.retries` for the feature is 2 after two single-retry dispatches" | diff-local |
| Story 1 happy: Given OTel is enabled, when the daemon starts, then exactly one MeterProvider exists for the daemon's lifetime and both dispatches of Story 1's feature are recorded onto it by the daemon's metrics listener from their forwarded events | 7 | "one `MeterProvider` and one `MetricsListener` are constructed per daemon start and two dispatches each wire a `metrics: false` visualizer" | diff-local |
| Story 1 happy: Given a dispatch runs in a process that exits at dispatch end, when its forwarded step and terminal events reach the daemon bus, then the same per-feature counters continue from their prior values, because no metric state lived in the exited process | 8 | "child-process-shaped fake that emits its events and exits, and asserts the feature's counters continue from their prior values" | diff-local |
| Story 1 negative: Given feature A's dispatch stops while feature B is still running under the same daemon, when A's per-dispatch visualizer stops, then the daemon meter is force-flushed (so A's final data points are exported before the daemon could die) but not shut down, the visualizer holds no meter of its own to shut down, and B's next step still exports conductor.step.duration{feature=B} | 6 | "a `metrics: false` visualizer constructs no `MeterProvider` and `stop()` calls no meter method while spans still flush" | diff-local |
| Story 1 negative: Given the daemon process itself restarts, when metrics resume, then counters restart from zero exactly once (an ordinary process restart) and the exported series carries the same identity so backend rate functions treat it as a counter reset, not a new series | 8 | "identical series identity attribute set with counters restarting from zero exactly once" | diff-local |
| Story 1 negative: Given OTel is disabled or the otel config block is absent, when the daemon starts and dispatches a feature, then no MeterProvider is constructed, no recorder is passed to the dispatch, and daemon behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged from today | 7 | "disabled or absent OTel config constructs no `MeterProvider` and leaves per-dispatch wiring unchanged" | diff-local |
| Story 2 happy: Given project P and a worker whose resolved name is W, when the daemon exports metrics, then the metric Resource carries service.name=ai-conductor, service.instance.id=P/W, conductor.project, conductor.worker=W, and host.name equal to the OS hostname | 4 | "`service.instance.id === 'P/W'` and `host.name` present" | diff-local |
| Story 2 happy: Given a per-feature instrument such as conductor.step.duration for feature S, when it is exported, then its data point carries project=P, worker=W, and feature=S as attributes | 5 | "a per-feature data point carries exactly `project`, `worker`, `feature` plus the instrument's own attributes" | diff-local |
| Story 2 happy: Given a daemon-level instrument such as conductor.daemon.backlog, when it is exported, then its data point carries project=P and worker=W and no feature attribute | 5 | "a daemon-level data point carries `project` and `worker` and has no `feature` key" | diff-local |
| Story 2 happy: Given otel.worker_name is set to a non-blank value in .ai-conductor/config.yml, when the daemon exports, then W is that trimmed value; given it is absent or blank, then W is the OS hostname | 3 | "the resolved worker is the trimmed value, the hostname, the hostname, and `unknown` respectively" | diff-local |
| Story 2 negative: Given the shared meter serves many features, when the metric Resource is inspected, then it carries no conductor.feature and no conductor.branch attribute (asserted on the exported Resource, not on data-point attributes) | 4 | "`conductor.feature` and `conductor.branch` are absent from the metric Resource and present on the trace Resource" | diff-local |
| Story 2 negative: Given a per-dispatch visualizer exports spans, when the trace Resource is inspected, then it still carries conductor.feature, conductor.branch, conductor.run.id, and conductor.engine.version, unchanged from today | 4 | "`conductor.feature` and `conductor.branch` are absent from the metric Resource and present on the trace Resource" | diff-local |
| Story 2 negative: Given os.hostname() throws or returns an empty string, when identity is resolved, then W falls back to the literal unknown and the daemon proceeds without failing | 3 | "an `os.hostname()` that throws" | diff-local |
| Story 3 happy: Given a running daemon with an empty backlog and no dispatch in flight, when a metrics export occurs, then conductor.daemon.up reads 1 and conductor.daemon.backlog{state} has a data point for each of eligible, waiting, blocked, gated, and parked (each 0) | 12 | "asserts `conductor.daemon.up` = 1, five backlog points reading 0, and both slot states are exported after one tick" | diff-local |
| Story 3 happy: Given discovery finds 3 eligible, 2 waiting, 1 blocked, 4 gated specs and 2 operator-parked features, when the tick's snapshot is exported, then conductor.daemon.backlog reads 3, 2, 1, 4, 2 for those states respectively | 11 | "all five `conductor.daemon.backlog` states are present with the exact counts" | diff-local |
| Story 3 happy: Given the oldest eligible spec became eligible 36 hours ago, when the snapshot is exported, then conductor.daemon.backlog.oldest_age{state=eligible} reads approximately 129600 seconds | 11 | "`oldest_age`, `slots`, `inflight`, `poll.duration`, and `up` data points match the snapshot payload" | diff-local |
| Story 3 happy: Given daemon concurrency is 3 and 2 features are in flight, when the snapshot is exported, then conductor.daemon.slots{state=busy} reads 2, conductor.daemon.slots{state=free} reads 1, and conductor.daemon.inflight{feature} reads 1 for each of the two in-flight slugs | 11 | "`oldest_age`, `slots`, `inflight`, `poll.duration`, and `up` data points match the snapshot payload" | diff-local |
| Story 3 happy: Given a discovery pass took 840 ms, when the snapshot is exported, then conductor.daemon.poll.duration has one observation of 840 ms | 9 | "`pollDurationMs` equals the measured discovery duration within 50 ms of a fake clock" | diff-local |
| Story 3 negative: Given the daemon is paused, when the snapshot is exported, then conductor.daemon.blocked_reason{reason=paused} reads 1 and the other three reasons read 0, so an idle-because-paused daemon is distinguishable from an idle-because-drained one | 11 | "`blocked_reason` reads 1 for `paused` and 0 for `build_auth_missing`, `gh_version`, `episode_active`" | diff-local |
| Story 3 negative: Given build auth is missing, when the snapshot is exported, then conductor.daemon.blocked_reason{reason=build_auth_missing} reads 1 | 11 | "a second snapshot with `build_auth_missing` true flips those values" | diff-local |
| Story 3 negative: Given the daemon is hard-killed, when the backend's next scrape interval passes, then conductor.daemon.up stops being reported (the series goes stale) rather than continuing to read 1 | 12 | "no `up` observation is recorded after the loop stops, so the series goes stale when the daemon dies" | diff-local |
| Story 3 negative: Given a backlog state has no members, when the snapshot is exported, then that state's data point reads 0 rather than being absent, so dashboards never show a gap for an empty state | 11 | "a zero-member state reads 0 rather than being absent" | diff-local |
| Story 3 negative: Given the backlog contains an eligible spec whose eligibility timestamp cannot be determined, when oldest_age is computed, then that spec is excluded from the age and the count still includes it | 10 | "a member with an unreadable marker is excluded from the age while `counts.eligible` still includes it" | diff-local |
| Story 4 happy: Given the daemon dispatches feature S for the first time, when the dispatch begins, then conductor.feature.dispatches{feature=S, kind=initial} increments by 1 | 13 | "`kind` is `initial`, `rekick`, and `resume` for the three fixtures above" | diff-local |
| Story 4 happy: Given feature S halts with class needs-human at step build_review and a halt record is written, when metrics are exported, then conductor.feature.halts{feature=S, haltClass=needs-human, step=build_review} reads 1 | 14 | "A test covers all eight sidecar values on `conductor.feature.halts`" | diff-local |

| Story 4 negative: Given a halt whose HALT.class sidecar is missing, unreadable, or holds an unrecognized value, when it is recorded, then haltClass carries the existing disposition value unclassified, never an invented label and never an empty string | 14 | "plus `legacy` and `unclassified` derivations" | diff-local |
| Story 4 negative: Given a halt from a build older than the class sidecar, when it is recorded, then haltClass carries the existing disposition value legacy | 14 | "plus `legacy` and `unclassified` derivations" | diff-local |
| Story 4 negative: Given a halt whose sidecar holds kickback-cap or over-scope (the two operator-owned classes the conductor writes beyond the base HaltClass union), when it is recorded, then haltClass carries that value verbatim rather than folding it to unclassified, so operator-attention halts are never miscounted as unknown | 14 | "`kickback-cap` and `over-scope` are recorded verbatim, not folded to `unclassified`" | diff-local |
| Story 4 negative: Given a feature is operator-parked, when metrics are exported, then it appears in conductor.daemon.backlog{state=parked} and increments neither conductor.feature.halts nor conductor.feature.shipped | 15 | "a parked feature is present in `conductor.daemon.backlog{state=parked}` and absent from `feature.halts` and `feature.shipped`" | diff-local |
| Story 4 negative: Given the daemon resumes a feature whose worktree already exists and which was not halted, when the dispatch begins, then kind is resume, not initial and not rekick | 13 | "`kind` is `initial`, `rekick`, and `resume` for the three fixtures above" | diff-local |
| Story 4 negative: Given the halt record write fails after the HALT marker was written, when metrics are exported, then conductor.feature.halts still increments from the loop_halt event and the metrics handler does not throw | 14 | "a halt still increments the counter when the halt-record write fails" | diff-local |
| Story 5 happy: Given gate build_review passes for feature S, when the verdict event is emitted, then conductor.gate.verdicts{feature=S, step=build_review, outcome=pass} increments by 1 | 18 | "the exact attribute sets and values for pass, fail-plus-kickback, and stall above" | diff-local |

| Story 5 negative: Given a gate verdict is emitted on the feature bus during a daemon dispatch, when it reaches the daemon-level listener, then it is counted exactly once (the forwarded copy is counted, the original is not double-counted) | 17 | "one feature-bus `gate_verdict` yields exactly one `conductor.gate.verdicts` point with value 1 and `feature=S`" | diff-local |

| Story 7 happy: Given a step_completed is emitted on a feature bus and forwarded to the daemon bus, when the daemon's metrics listener records it, then the resulting conductor.step.duration data point carries that feature's slug as its feature attribute and the same attribute keys, unit, and name as the pre-change instrument | 20 | "recorded from a forwarded event stream with the pre-change names, units, and attribute keys" | diff-local |
| Story 7 happy: Given the three new event types exist, when the event-sink registry is compiled, then each has a sink declaration row with otel true and the OTel subscription list derived from the registry includes them | 1 | "`otelEventTypes()` and `persistedEventTypes()` each contain the four new type names" | diff-local |
| Story 7 negative: Given a gate_verdict is emitted on a feature bus and forwarded to the daemon bus, when both ledgers are read, then the event appears once in that feature's .pipeline/events.jsonl and zero times in .daemon/events.jsonl | 2 | "a forwarded gate_verdict appears once in the feature ledger and zero times in the daemon ledger" | diff-local |
| Story 7 negative: Given a new event type is added to the union without a sink row, when the project compiles, then compilation fails naming the missing row | 1 | "a union member without an EVENT_SINKS row fails compilation" | diff-local |
| Story 7 negative: Given a new event type has a sink row with otel true but no metrics-listener handler case, when the listener coverage test runs, then it fails naming the unhandled type | 19 | "names any `otel: true` event type lacking a `MetricsListener` handler and passes with every case present" | diff-local |
| Story 7 negative: Given the daemon ledger's directory is unwritable, when a snapshot is emitted, then the daemon logs the write failure once, the metrics are still recorded, and the loop continues | 2 | "one logged failure line, no throw, and the emitter still delivers the event to other subscribers" | diff-local |
| Story 8 happy: Given OTel is enabled and conduct runs interactively, when the run completes, then the visualizer owns the TracerProvider, a metrics listener on the same run bus owns an interactive MeterProvider, the existing instruments are exported with unchanged names and attributes, and both providers are shut down on stop | 19 | "the interactive exported instrument set (names, units, attribute keys) equals the pre-change set" | diff-local |
| Story 8 happy: Given the interactive path, when the metric Resource is inspected, then service.instance.id is P/W with W resolved exactly as in Story 2 and per-feature data points still carry feature | 19 | "the metric Resource is `P/W` with `feature` on per-feature points" | diff-local |
| Story 8 negative: Given the interactive path passes no spans-only flag, when the visualizer and listener initialize, then the listener constructs its own meter and the visualizer initializes without throwing on the absent flag | 19 | "a visualizer without the `metrics` flag initializes without throwing" | diff-local |
| Story 8 negative: Given the interactive listener owns its meter, when the run stops, then meterProvider.shutdown() is called exactly once | 19 | "the interactive listener's meter receives `shutdown()` exactly once on stop" | diff-local |

## Amendment 2026-09-08 — as-built identity, inflight scope, and backlog state age

The operator resolved as-built DESIGN findings AB-6, AB-7, and AB-10 as follows. Task 4 must leave
the trace Resource byte-identical to its pre-feature shape, including the existing trace
`service.instance.id`; only the metric Resource is re-keyed to project/worker. Task 5 treats
`conductor.daemon.inflight` as the sole feature-scoped `conductor.daemon.*` instrument and attaches
the in-flight slug as `feature`; every other daemon instrument remains feature-free. Task 10 replaces
the immutable first-ever-discovery marker with durable per-slug `{ state, enteredAt }` state: repeat
discovery in the same state preserves `enteredAt`, while a transition replaces it, and oldest age is
computed from residence in each current state. The component and sequence diagrams and Stories 2–3
carry the same corrected contracts. Existing tests are amended or extended in their owning tasks;
no new telemetry channel or provider-specific path is introduced.

### Task rem-prd-audit-rem-flush-1: src/conductor/src/engine/otel/wire.ts:66-88 — return an additional `flush()` alongside `stop()` from wireDaemonOtel that awaits meterProvider.forceFlush() WITHOUT calling shutdown(), and call it from the per-dispatch teardown in src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts:1161-1167 (where the dispatch visualizer and feature persister are stopped) so a stopping dispatch flushes its final points while the shared daemon meter stays alive for other in-flight features; leave the shutdown path at wire.ts:85-87 and daemon-cli.ts:2452-2454 byte-identical so Task 7's 'forceFlush() and shutdown() exactly once each on daemon shutdown' assertion still passes, and add a test asserting flush() calls forceFlush once and shutdown zero times and that a second feature still exports conductor.step.duration afterwards
**Gate:** prd-audit
**Rationale:** The daemon MeterProvider is force-flushed only inside stop() at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/wire.ts:85-87, reached only from daemon shutdown at src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts:2452-2454, while per-dispatch teardown at src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts:1161-1167 stops the spans-only visualizer and the feature persister and never touches the daemon meter, so a stopping dispatch's final points can be lost if the daemon dies before the next periodic export. The approved architecture already decides this behavior (the feature sequence diagram requires flush-without-shutdown at feature stop, and the sealed Story 1 negative criterion states it), so no architectural decision is open and this is conforming implementation drift, not architectural-clarity. It is the one gap no existing plan task's Done when admits: task 6's clauses cover only that a metrics:false visualizer constructs no MeterProvider and that spans still flush, and task 7's only flush clause is 'daemon shutdown ... forceFlush() and shutdown() exactly once each' — neither admits a per-dispatch flush seam — so this routes to build with one appended task rather than existing-task. Sibling sweep: the interactive wiring at wire.ts:91-124 owns its own meter for a single run and shuts it down once via the idempotent stopped guard at wire.ts:123, so it has no analogous mid-life flush seam and is deliberately excluded. No assertion is removed: the task explicitly preserves task 7's shutdown-path flush/shutdown counts and the existing span-flush tests.
**Criterion:** S1.5
**Parent task:** 6
**Done when:**
- S1.5 is satisfied by this task.

> **Amended 2026-09-08 by #1937:** The two Story 4 halt-classification rows in the Coverage Check are superseded by the accepted story wording: unreadable or unrecognized sidecars derive `unclassified`; an absent `HALT.class` with `HALT` present derives `legacy`.

> **Amended 2026-09-08 by operator resolution of AB-4:** The preceding amendment is superseded to conform to `adr-2026-07-28-total-halt-classification-legacy-boundary` D2-D3. Task 14 treats an absent, unreadable, or unrecognized `HALT.class` as `unclassified`; `legacy` is reported only when the one-time migration has explicitly stamped that value into the sidecar. Task 14 must repair `readHaltSidecarClassification` (or reuse the conforming read path) and cover both the absent-sidecar fail-closed case and the explicitly stamped legacy case.

## Amendment 2026-09-08 — daemon stall identity

The operator confirmed ADR-014 Decision 8's existing identity contract: `conductor.daemon.inflight`
is the sole feature-scoped `conductor.daemon.*` instrument. Task 18 therefore records
`conductor.daemon.stalls` with `reason` plus project/worker identity and no `feature` attribute.
The implementation repair stays within Task 18; no new event or telemetry channel is introduced.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab4-1: src/conductor/src/engine/halt-marker.ts:272-292 — in readHaltSidecarClassification make the catch arm return 'unclassified' for every read failure including ENOENT, and add the literal 'legacy' to the recognized-content list at :279-286 so a sidecar stamped by src/conductor/src/engine/halt-class-migration.ts:25 reports 'legacy' verbatim; rewrite the stale doc comment at :267-270 to state the fail-closed rule; leave readHaltClass at halt-marker.ts:240-265 byte-identical; update src/conductor/test/engine/halt-marker.test.ts:298-307 so the absent-sidecar case expects 'unclassified' while its existing 'kickback-cap' and 'mechanical' assertions are preserved, and add cases asserting a sidecar whose content is exactly 'legacy' resolves to 'legacy', that an unreadable sidecar resolves to 'unclassified', and that 'over-scope' still resolves verbatim
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** src/conductor/src/engine/halt-marker.ts:290-292 returns 'legacy' when the HALT.class sidecar is absent (ENOENT) and :279-288 omits the literal 'legacy' from its recognized-content list, so a sidecar stamped by src/conductor/src/engine/halt-class-migration.ts:22-31 falls through to 'unclassified' — exactly inverting Task 14's operator AB-4 amendment and adr-2026-07-28-total-halt-classification-legacy-boundary D2-D3. The approved architecture already decides this behavior, so it is conforming implementation drift routed to build, not an open architectural question. Not existing-task: two prior remediation laps bound this finding to plan task 14 and the resulting BUILD landed only commit f53de908a, which changed artifacts and left halt-marker.ts untouched, so the broad task Done-when did not pin the defect and the repair is emitted as one concrete file-scoped task. Sibling sweep: the stale doc comment at halt-marker.ts:267-270 asserts the superseded rule and is repaired in the same task; the matched pair is readHaltSidecarClassification's recognized-content list and the literal stampLegacy writes at halt-class-migration.ts:25, and both are named in the task so they cannot drift. The separate re-kick reader readHaltClass at halt-marker.ts:240-265 is found and deliberately excluded: Task 14's Done-when requires its behavior stay unchanged. No coverage is dropped — the same test must keep asserting 'kickback-cap' and 'mechanical' verbatim (criterion S4.7).
**Governing clause:** Task 14
**Parent task:** 14
**Done when:**
- Task 14 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab1-1: src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts:9-38,54-60,78-129 — replace the Record<OtelEventType, true> declaration map with a Record<OtelEventType, handler> whose values are the real per-type projection functions extracted from the handle() switch, drop the `as never` cast so tsc enforces exhaustiveness against OtelEventType, and have start() subscribe by iterating otelEventTypes() from src/conductor/src/engine/event-sinks.ts and looking each type up in that map so subscriptions and handlers can no longer disagree; keep the best-effort try/catch wrapper at :57 and every existing projection's recorder call unchanged, and add a test in src/conductor/test/engine/otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts that fails naming the offending type when a declared otel:true sink has no real handler implementation, while the existing subscription assertion at :69-80 and the per-feature exporter assertions at :55-67 keep passing
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts:9-38 declares METRICS_HANDLERS as Record<OtelEventType, true>, start() at :54-60 derives subscriptions from that map, and handle() at :78-129 ends in `default: return assertNeverEvent(event as never)` whose cast defeats the exhaustiveness check while the throw is swallowed by the best-effort catch at :57; src/conductor/test/engine/otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts:69-80 compares subscribed types against otelEventTypes() only, so a declared type with no switch case stays green and records nothing. Approved architecture is unchanged — Task 19's Done-when already requires the detection mechanism — so this is conforming implementation drift routed to build. Not existing-task: the prior lap bound this to plan task 19 and commit bbe4f73e1 closed only the subscription half, leaving the handler-case half open, so the remedy is emitted as one concrete task. Matched-pair note: METRICS_HANDLERS and the handle() switch are the duplicated enumeration; the repair derives one from the other rather than editing a single side. Sibling sweep: the same `as never` pattern was checked across the file and appears only at :36-38; the parity test's per-feature exporter assertions at otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts:55-67 are preserved, not replaced.
**Governing clause:** Task 19
**Parent task:** 19
**Done when:**
- Task 19 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab3-1: src/conductor/src/engine/daemon.ts:1653-1657 — before the busy-pool `await emitTick()`, re-sample all four dispatch gates (checkPaused, checkBuildAuthMissing, checkGhVersionFloor, deps.rateLimitEpisode.active) into paused/buildAuthMissing/ghVersionBlocked/episodeActive and refresh latestBlocked exactly as the free-slot branch does at :1348-1357, so emitTick reports the current pass's flags on both branches without cancelling in-flight work; rename and rewrite src/conductor/test/engine/daemon.test.ts:75-124 so the busy tick asserts the freshly probed true values for all four blockers while the idle tick keeps its false values, keep its existing discoverBacklog-called-twice and pollDurationMs assertions, and assert the probe call counts so a hardcoded-false snapshot fails
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** src/conductor/src/engine/daemon.ts:1319-1322 seeds paused/buildAuthMissing/ghVersionBlocked/episodeActive from the cached latestBlocked and only the free-slot branch at :1348-1357 re-samples them, so the busy-pool pass at :1653-1657 refreshes discovery but emits the prior pass's gate flags through emitTick at :1325-1337; src/conductor/test/engine/daemon.test.ts:75-124 makes every second gate probe return true while asserting the stale false values, pinning the defect. Task 9's Done-when requires each pass's exact flags on both branches and sealed criteria S3.6/S3.7 require the current blocked state, and the approved design is unchanged, so this is conforming implementation drift routed to build. Not existing-task: the prior lap bound this to plan task 9 and commit 731142359 refreshed only the discovery snapshot, leaving the flags cached, so the remedy is emitted concretely. Sibling sweep: the four gate predicates are one closed set and must be re-probed together; the build_review testQuality finding that daemon.test.ts:75-124 never asserts a true blocker is the same site and is closed in this task. No coverage is dropped — the busy-branch invocation and the free-slot-branch assertions Task 9 requires both remain asserted, and the rule that a newly active dispatch gate does not cancel in-flight work stays in force.
**Governing clause:** Task 9
**Parent task:** 9
**Done when:**
- Task 9 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab2-1: src/conductor/src/engine/otel/wire.ts:87-91,124-129 — add a module-local helper that awaits one meter lifecycle promise under a bounded timeout and catches both rejection and timeout, emitting exactly one renderer_error per wiring on that wiring's own emitter with the existing '[otel] metric export failed: ' prefix, then route all four call sites through it (daemon flush forceFlush, daemon stop forceFlush then shutdown, interactive stop forceFlush then shutdown); keep the call count and order unchanged so the existing daemon-shutdown forceFlush-and-shutdown-exactly-once assertion in src/conductor/test/daemon-otel-wiring.test.ts and the flush-calls-forceFlush-once-and-shutdown-zero-times assertion both still pass, keep the `stopped` memoization at wire.ts:88,128 so stop() still runs at most once, leave warnOnceMetricExporter at wire.ts:132-150 byte-identical, and add tests asserting that a rejecting forceFlush() and a never-settling shutdown() each leave daemon per-dispatch teardown at src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts:1197-1204 and interactive stop resolving without throwing, that exactly one renderer_error is emitted per wiring, and that a second dispatch still records conductor.step.duration after a failed flush
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** adr-014-otel-observability-exporter Decision 5 requires exporter and transport failures to be caught and degraded to one bounded warning without failing or wedging a run, but src/conductor/src/engine/otel/wire.ts:87-91 (daemon flush and stop) and :124-129 (interactive stop) await provider.forceFlush() and provider.shutdown() with no catch and no timeout, and those rejections propagate through the awaited per-dispatch teardown at src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts:1197-1204 and daemon shutdown at :2484-2486. The approved architecture already decides this behavior, so it is conforming implementation drift routed to build. It is the one finding no existing plan task admits: task 7's only flush clause is a call-count contract, the appended flush task's Done-when is limited to criterion S1.5, and the obligation row mapping ADR-014 D5 to task 2 covers only the unwritable daemon ledger at src/conductor/src/engine/event-persister.ts:227-238. Sibling sweep: both meter lifecycles (daemon and interactive) are the matched pair and are contained in the same task; the exporter-level warn-once at wire.ts:132-150 already covers export() failures and is deliberately left byte-identical so its single-warning semantics are not duplicated, and event-persister.ts:227-238's own try/catch is found and excluded because task 2 owns it. No coverage is removed: task 7's forceFlush-and-shutdown-exactly-once assertion and the appended flush task's flush-without-shutdown assertions must both still pass, so containment wraps the calls without changing their count or order.
**Governing clause:** adr-014-otel-observability-exporter decision 5
**Done when:**
- adr-014-otel-observability-exporter decision 5 is satisfied by this task.
