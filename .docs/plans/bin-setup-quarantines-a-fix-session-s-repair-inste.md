# Implementation Plan: Setup fix-session repairs must converge (#1346)

**Date:** 2026-08-29
**Design:** [approved architecture review](../decisions/architecture-review-2026-08-29-bin-setup-quarantines-a-fix-session-s-repair-inste.md)
**Stories:** [accepted stories](../stories/bin-setup-quarantines-a-fix-session-s-repair-inste.md)
**Conflict check:** Clean as of 2026-08-29 after two operator-approved inherited-story corrections

## Summary

Make the bounded daemon setup fix-session converge by proving its original HEAD, snapshotting the
provider's complete Git tree, force-running setup, and retaining only an unchanged verified repair.
Fourteen small TDD tasks add the Git transaction, preserve rejected attempts before restoration,
and publish one typed repair disposition through the existing event spine.

## Technical Approach

- Keep the change inside `engine/setup-triage.ts` and the existing daemon-only
  `runSetupTriage` closure. Before provider dispatch, resolve the original HEAD and require an empty
  porcelain result. A failed precondition parks before dispatch and emits no `setup_repair`, because
  no repair session was attempted.
- Represent the provider candidate by a Git tree OID plus HEAD and paths. For dirty candidates,
  stage the complete worktree with `git add -A`, obtain the tree via `git write-tree`, then restore
  the clean-start index with `git reset --mixed <candidate-head>`; this preserves working-tree bytes
  while making modifications, deletions, modes, and untracked additions part of one comparable Git
  identity. Repeating that snapshot after forced setup makes setup-added drift a tree-ID mismatch.
- Partition success mechanically. An unchanged HEAD with no Git-visible change is
  `verified-no-tree-change`. A clean forward descendant of the original HEAD is
  `accepted-existing-commit`. An unchanged HEAD with a dirty, setup-stable candidate is staged and
  committed as `fix(setup): retain verified repair` through the existing worktree-rooted
  `makeGitRunner`, whose `git commit` path already sets `CONDUCT_ENGINE_COMMIT=1`. The engine then
  verifies the new parent, committed tree, HEAD, and final clean porcelain before `fixed-pass`.
- Do not reuse stage-1 `quarantine()` for rejected fix sessions: its `HEAD~1` reset assumes exactly
  one temporary commit. Add a repair-attempt preservation helper that gathers committed and
  uncommitted paths, creates a preservation commit only when residue exists, force-moves
  `wip/setup-quarantine-<slug>` to the complete attempted state, verifies that ref, and only then
  resets the feature branch to the original HEAD. Ref, commit, or verification failure performs no
  destructive restore; restoration failure retains the already-verified ref.
- Use this closed rejection vocabulary:
  `provider-failure`, `history-rewritten`, `mixed-commit-and-residue`,
  `setup-still-failing`, `setup-drift`, `snapshot-failed`, `repair-commit-failed`,
  `repair-postcondition-failed`, `preservation-failed`, and `restoration-failed`.
  `precondition-failed` is a pre-dispatch contract outcome, not a repair event reason.
- Add `setup_repair` to `ConductorEvent` as a discriminated success/rejection union. A single
  settlement helper in `fixSession` emits exactly once after every attempted fix-session terminal
  path; `runSetupTriage` passes its existing feature-scoped emitter. The exhaustive `EVENT_SINKS`
  registry declares render + persist, the daemon renderer writes one line, and `EventPersister`
  requires no new code.
- Follow the existing real-local-Git fixtures in `test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`: isolated
  `mkdtemp`, pinned initial branch and local identity, no remotes, exact cleanup. Use injected
  provider and forced-prepare callbacks; ordinary tests never invoke a real LLM, third-party
  service, package command, or consumer `bin/setup` process.

## Prerequisites

- The #1346 amendment to `adr-2026-07-09-setup-failure-triage`, accepted stories, clean conflict
  report, and approved lightweight architecture review are present on this spec branch.
- No dependency, database, configuration, CLI, hook-wiring, or migration change is required.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Declare the repair event and exhaustive sink contract
**Story:** Story 4 — typed dispositions, closed rejection reasons, and sink omission failure
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write a failing event-sink registry test that constructs success and rejected `setup_repair`
   events and expects `{ render: true, persist: true, audit: false, otel: false }`.
2. Verify RED through the test-inclusive typecheck and the focused registry test.
3. Add exported repair disposition/rejection types and the discriminated `setup_repair` member to
   `ConductorEvent`; add the exhaustive sink declaration.
4. Verify GREEN, including that deleting the sink entry produces the compile-time missing-key
   failure supplied by `Record<ConductorEvent['type'], SinkDeclaration>`.
5. Commit with message: `feat(setup-triage): declare repair disposition event (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. `npm run typecheck:test` accepts all three success dispositions, the rejected variant, and all ten rejection reasons.
2. `test/event-sink-registry.test.ts` asserts render + persist and no audit/OTel subscription.
3. The exhaustive `EVENT_SINKS` record is the named mechanism preventing an undeclared sink.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/types/events.ts`
- `src/conductor/src/engine/event-sinks.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/event-sink-registry.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 2: Render one concise repair disposition line
**Story:** Story 4 — daemon-log visibility for accepted and rejected repairs
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Add failing renderer cases for `engine-committed`, `accepted-existing-commit`,
   `verified-no-tree-change`, and a rejected event with reason plus quarantine ref.
2. Verify RED in the focused renderer test.
3. Add one `setup_repair` switch case to `renderDaemonEventUnsafe`; render the disposition once and
   append rejection reason/ref only when present.
4. Verify GREEN and retain the renderer's existing catch-and-drop safety behavior.
5. Commit with message: `feat(daemon): render setup repair dispositions (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. Each success disposition renders one line naming that disposition.
2. A rejected event renders its closed reason and optional quarantine ref without inventing a ref.
3. `test/engine/daemon-render.test.ts` passes in isolation.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/daemon-render.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Task 3: Snapshot a complete repair candidate as a Git tree
**Story:** Story 1 — exact candidate tree before and after forced setup
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Add failing real-local-Git tests for a clean tree and for a candidate containing a tracked edit,
   deletion, executable-mode change, and untracked addition; assert HEAD/worktree content are
   unchanged after capture and the index is reset to the candidate HEAD.
2. Verify RED in `setup-triage.test.ts`.
3. Implement a focused snapshot helper returning HEAD, tree OID, dirty flag, and parsed paths via
   `status --porcelain`, `add -A`, `write-tree`, and `reset --mixed`; return a typed failure for
   every non-zero Git operation.
4. Verify GREEN and prove a second snapshot after a no-op callback returns the same tree OID.
5. Commit with message: `feat(setup-triage): capture exact repair tree (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. The real-Git fixture's tree resolves to the expected tracked edit, deletion, mode, and untracked file.
2. Snapshotting changes neither HEAD nor working-tree bytes, and leaves the index at HEAD.
3. Each `status`/`add`/`write-tree`/`reset --mixed` failure returns `snapshot-failed` in a table test.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 4: Preserve a complete rejected attempt before restoration
**Story:** Story 3 — provider commits and residue remain recoverable before reset
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Add failing real-local-Git tests for a clean provider-commit chain and for provider commits plus
   tracked/untracked residue; assert the quarantine ref contains the full attempted history/tree
   and is verified before restoration.
2. Verify RED in the focused setup-triage test.
3. Implement the repair-attempt preservation helper: union `git diff --name-only
   <original> <attempted>` with porcelain paths, make a preservation commit only for residue,
   force-move and verify the slug-scoped ref, then reset hard to the original HEAD.
4. Verify GREEN and leave the existing stage-1 `quarantine()` behavior unchanged.
5. Commit with message: `feat(setup-triage): preserve full rejected repair attempt (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. A clean rejected commit chain is reachable from the quarantine ref with no synthetic empty preservation commit.
2. A mixed commit-plus-residue attempt's ref contains both provider history and every residue path.
3. The feature branch restores to the original HEAD only after `rev-parse --verify` proves the ref.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 3

### Task 5: Accept verified no-change and clean forward-commit repairs
**Story:** Story 2 — existing safe repair outcomes remain accepted
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Replace/add failing `fixSession` tests for a provider that changes no Git state and for one or
   more clean commits that are forward descendants of the original HEAD.
2. Verify RED against the new disposition assertions.
3. Record/prove the original clean HEAD before provider dispatch; after dispatch classify ancestry,
   run the injected forced prepare once, and require HEAD plus the complete Git tree to remain
   unchanged before returning `fixed-pass` without an engine commit.
4. Add the precondition negative: dirty/indeterminate initial state parks as
   `precondition-failed`, dispatches no provider, and emits no repair event.
5. Commit with message: `feat(setup-triage): accept safe existing repair states (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. No-change repair returns `fixed-pass` without an empty commit.
2. A clean forward commit chain returns `fixed-pass` without an additional engine commit.
3. Initial HEAD/status failure or dirt dispatches zero fix sessions and returns
   `precondition-failed`.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 3

### Task 6: Commit an unchanged uncommitted repair exactly
**Story:** Story 1 — verified uncommitted repair becomes durable branch history
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Add a failing real-local-Git acceptance case whose injected fix callback creates a tracked edit
   and untracked addition without moving HEAD and whose injected prepare callback is a no-op.
2. Verify RED: current behavior quarantines and parks.
3. On unchanged original HEAD plus a dirty candidate, snapshot before and after prepare, require
   equal tree OIDs, stage/commit with `fix(setup): retain verified repair`, then verify parent,
   committed tree, HEAD, and empty porcelain.
4. Verify GREEN and assert the fix callback and prepare callback each ran exactly once before the
   normal continuation sentinel is reached.
5. Commit with message: `fix(setup-triage): retain verified uncommitted repair (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. The feature branch advances by one commit whose parent is the original HEAD and whose tree equals the pre-setup candidate tree.
2. The committed tree contains both the tracked edit and untracked addition, and porcelain is empty.
3. The acceptance fixture observes one fix dispatch, one forced-prepare callback, and continuation.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/acceptance/bin-setup-quarantines-a-fix-session-s-repair-inste.acceptance.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 3, Task 5

### Task 7: Reject a still-failing setup without inventing a repair
**Story:** Story 2 negative — no-change failure creates no empty commit; Story 3 preservation rule
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Add failing tests for a no-change provider whose forced prepare throws and a clean provider
   commit whose forced prepare throws.
2. Verify RED against the expected `setup-still-failing` outcomes.
3. Route no-change failure directly to park with no commit/ref; route a changed attempt through the
   full preservation helper before restoring the original HEAD.
4. Verify GREEN and preserve the original setup error tail in the outcome.
5. Commit with message: `fix(setup-triage): preserve changed repairs when setup still fails (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. No-change failure creates neither an empty commit nor a quarantine ref.
2. A committed repair that still fails setup is reachable from the quarantine ref before restore.
3. Both cases park with `setup-still-failing` and never return `fixed-pass`.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 4, Task 5

### Task 8: Reject setup-added or setup-altered Git drift
**Story:** Story 1 negative — forced setup must not contaminate the candidate
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Add failing real-local-Git cases where the injected prepare callback modifies the candidate,
   deletes one candidate path, and adds a new untracked path.
2. Verify RED against the expected `setup-drift` preserve-and-park outcome.
3. Compare the pre/post setup tree OIDs and route every mismatch through full-attempt preservation;
   never stage the mismatched tree as the accepted repair commit.
4. Verify GREEN and assert the quarantine ref contains the complete post-setup attempted state
   before the feature branch returns to the original HEAD.
5. Commit with message: `fix(setup-triage): reject setup drift from repair commits (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. Modified, deleted, and newly added setup-drift fixtures all produce `setup-drift`.
2. No accepted repair commit remains on the feature branch in any drift fixture.
3. Each quarantine ref contains the attempted state that existed immediately before restoration.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 4, Task 6

### Task 9: Reject rewritten history and mixed commits with residue
**Story:** Story 2 negative and Story 3 happy — off-contract history remains recoverable
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Add failing real-local-Git cases where the provider rewrites away the original HEAD and where it
   creates forward commits plus uncommitted residue.
2. Verify RED against `history-rewritten` and `mixed-commit-and-residue`.
3. Classify ancestry with `merge-base --is-ancestor` and partition clean commits from residue before
   prepare acceptance; send both rejected classes through full-attempt preservation.
4. Verify GREEN, including committed path names in `preservedPaths` and restoration to the original
   HEAD only after ref verification.
5. Commit with message: `fix(setup-triage): reject unsafe repair history shapes (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. Non-forward history cannot return `fixed-pass` and is preserved under `history-rewritten`.
2. Forward commits plus any residue cannot return `fixed-pass` and are preserved under
   `mixed-commit-and-residue`.
3. The mixed fixture's quarantine ref retains both provider commits and residue in one reachable
   history.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 4, Task 5

### Task 10: Reject repair-commit and postcondition failures
**Story:** Story 1 negative and Story 3 happy — failed engine transaction is recoverable
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Add failing injected-Git cases for commit failure and for each postcondition family: wrong
   parent, wrong committed tree/HEAD, and final dirty porcelain.
2. Verify RED against `repair-commit-failed` or `repair-postcondition-failed` as applicable.
3. Funnel each failure through the full-attempt preservation helper and restore only after its ref
   verification; include the failed postcondition in `outputTail`.
4. Verify GREEN and assert no failure path reports `fixed-pass` or a clean/restored claim it did not
   prove.
5. Commit with message: `fix(setup-triage): fail closed on repair commit postconditions (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. Commit exit failure produces `repair-commit-failed` and preserves the candidate when possible.
2. Parent, tree/HEAD, and porcelain mismatches each produce `repair-postcondition-failed` naming the
   failed check.
3. Every case either restores after a verified ref or leaves the attempted state in place.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 4, Task 6

### Task 11: Make preservation and restoration failures non-destructive
**Story:** Story 3 — preservation failure, ref refresh failure, and restoration failure
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Add failing fault-injection cases for residue commit failure, force-refresh failure over an
   existing ref, ref-verification failure, and reset-hard failure after a verified ref.
2. Verify RED in the focused setup-triage test.
3. Return `preservation-failed` before any destructive restore for commit/ref/verification faults;
   return `restoration-failed` with the durable ref after reset failure.
4. Verify GREEN and assert an older ref is never reported as proof of the current attempt.
5. Commit with message: `fix(setup-triage): retain rejected state on recovery faults (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. Commit, ref-refresh, and ref-verification failures execute zero `reset --hard <original>` calls.
2. Reset failure reports `restoration-failed` and the refreshed ref still resolves to the complete
   attempted state.
3. The outcome never claims restored/clean state unless both ref verification and reset succeeded.

- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 4, Task 8, Task 9, Task 10

### Task 12: Emit exactly one success disposition per attempted fix-session
**Story:** Story 4 happy — all accepted terminal dispositions are structured occurrences
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Add failing emitter-spy cases around the no-change, clean-forward-commit, and exact-engine-commit
   paths.
2. Verify RED because `fixSession` currently emits no repair event.
3. Add one settlement helper used by every post-dispatch return; accept an optional injected feature
   emitter and emit `verified-no-tree-change`, `accepted-existing-commit`, or `engine-committed`.
4. Verify GREEN and assert the precondition-failed/no-dispatch path emits zero events.
5. Commit with message: `feat(setup-triage): emit successful repair dispositions (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. Each accepted repair shape emits exactly one `setup_repair` with its matching disposition.
2. No accepted path emits `rejected`, and no path emits more than once.
3. Precondition refusal before provider dispatch emits no `setup_repair`.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 1, Task 5, Task 6

### Task 13: Emit one closed rejection disposition for every attempted failure
**Story:** Story 4 happy/negative — rejected event reason, ref accuracy, and provider failure
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Add a failing table test that drives all ten closed rejection reasons through their owning
   terminal paths and records emitted events.
2. Verify RED against missing or duplicate events.
3. Route every attempted-session rejection through the settlement helper; attach a quarantine ref
   and paths only after current-attempt preservation succeeds, and emit `provider-failure` without
   an invented ref when dispatch throws before changing state.
4. Verify GREEN and assert the returned HALT evidence fields agree with the emitted reason/ref.
5. Commit with message: `feat(setup-triage): emit closed repair rejection evidence (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. The table covers provider, history, mixed residue, setup failure, setup drift, snapshot, repair commit, repair postcondition, preservation, and restoration rejection reasons.
2. Every row emits exactly one rejected event and returns a park outcome with the same reason.
3. Only successfully preserved rows carry the current attempt's ref; provider/preservation failures
   carry none.

**Files:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 7, Task 8, Task 9, Task 10, Task 11, Task 12

### Task 14: Wire feature-scoped persistence, rendering, and durable park behavior
**Story:** Story 3 scan/unpark bound; Story 4 persistence, HALT evidence, and unaffected-path silence
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Add failing wiring/acceptance cases proving production `runSetupTriage` passes `featureEvents` to
   `fixSession`, a terminal event reaches a real `EventPersister` and renderer once, and ordinary
   setup/stage-1-only recovery produces no `setup_repair` record.
2. Add a focused rejected-repair case to the existing automatic-park acceptance fixture: subsequent
   backlog scans invoke zero additional triage sessions; explicit unpark permits one new attempt.
3. Verify RED for missing event wiring while the existing generic park behavior remains green.
4. Pass the feature emitter at the production call site; rely on the existing feature persister,
   renderer subscription, HALT formatter, and durable park boundary rather than adding another
   writer or state file.
5. Verify GREEN and commit with message: `feat(daemon): persist setup repair outcomes on feature spine (#1346)`.

**Done when:**
1. The production call structurally passes its feature-scoped emitter, and one emitted event yields exactly one `events.jsonl` record plus one rendered daemon line.
2. A rejected HALT names its reason, current quarantine ref/paths when present, or the preservation
   failure when absent; ordinary setup and stage-1-only recovery write no `setup_repair` record.
3. After a rejected repair parks, repeated backlog discovery dispatches zero new fix sessions until
   unpark; after unpark, at most one new attempt runs before a fresh park.

- `src/conductor/test/acceptance/automatic-park-outcome-writes-no-park-marker-so-an.acceptance.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** Task 2, Task 11, Task 13

### Task 15: Prove no repair state exists when the provider throws before touching the tree
**Story:** Story 4 — provider-failure rejection states that no repair state was preserved
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Add a failing real-local-Git acceptance case whose injected fix callback throws before writing anything, asserting the rejection carries `provider-failure`, no invented ref, a proof that the tree is unchanged since dispatch, and a HALT body stating no repair state was preserved because none was produced.
2. Verify RED: `setup-triage.ts:671` rejects immediately with no post-throw state proof, and the HALT can say only `No quarantine ref exists (clean-HEAD case)`.
3. Capture the tree OID at dispatch and re-read it after the throw, and carry that proof into the rejection so the no-state claim is evidence rather than an inference from a missing ref.
4. Render the HALT from that proof in `daemon-runner.ts`, so a clean-HEAD-because-nothing-ran case reads differently from a clean-HEAD-because-the-repair-was-reverted case.
5. Verify GREEN and assert the fix callback ran exactly once and no commit, quarantine branch, or ref was created.
6. Commit with message: `fix(setup-triage): prove no repair state on provider failure (#1346)`.

**Done when:**

1. A fix callback that throws before touching the tree produces a rejection whose reason is `provider-failure` and whose ref field is absent rather than invented.
2. The rejection carries a post-throw proof that the tree OID is unchanged since dispatch, so the no-state claim rests on evidence and not on the absence of a ref.
3. The HALT body states explicitly that no repair state was preserved because none was produced, and is distinguishable from the existing `No quarantine ref exists (clean-HEAD case)` wording.
4. No commit, quarantine branch, or ref is created on this path, and the fix callback is dispatched exactly once.

## Integration Points

- After Task 6: the three accepted repair shapes are mechanically distinguishable and the
  uncommitted path produces an exact, verified engine commit.
- After Task 11: every state-changing rejection is either reachable from the slug-scoped ref before
  restore or remains untouched in the worktree when preservation fails.
- After Task 14: the production feature emitter persists/renders the disposition and the existing
  HALT/park boundary prevents automatic redispatch of a rejected repair.

## Coverage Mapping

| S3 negative — existing ref refresh failure is not false proof | 11 |
| S3 negative — restoration failure retains ref and accurate evidence | 11 |
| S3 negative — explicit unpark permits at most one new rotation attempt | 14 |
| S4 happy — exactly one of four dispositions per attempted session | 12, 13 |
| S4 happy — persisted/rendered once; rejected HALT carries durable evidence | 1, 2, 14 |
| S4 negative — provider failure has no invented ref | 13 |
| S4 negative — ordinary setup/stage-1 recovery emits no repair event | 14 |
| S4 negative — omitted sink/renderer/persister wiring fails verification | 1, 2, 14 |

- [ ] `cd src/conductor && npm run typecheck:test` exits 0 and covers source plus tests.
- [ ] `cd src/conductor && npm run lint` exits 0 with zero warnings.
- [ ] The configured aggregate `cd src/conductor && npm test` completes under five minutes and
      prints `AGGREGATE_TEST_SUITE_PASS` at the normal test-suite gate.
- [ ] All happy and negative story criteria map to tasks above; all task dependencies are explicit
      and acyclic; no task is a terminal catch-all validation task.

### Task rem-prd-audit-rem-s21-1: src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts - add an active 'fixSession accepted repair dispositions (Task 5)' describe after the rejection table at :987, with an injected stateful GitRunner fake modelled on rejectionGit(:876) that records every invocation's argv, covering both accept shapes at setup-triage.ts:712: (a) no-change - HEAD and HEAD^{tree} identical before and after dispatch, clean porcelain throughout, prepare succeeds => outcome { kind: 'fixed-pass', contractOutcome: 'verified-no-tree-change' }; (b) clean forward commit - dispatch advances HEAD to a descendant, 'merge-base --is-ancestor' exits 0, porcelain clean, post-prepare HEAD and tree unchanged => outcome { kind: 'fixed-pass', contractOutcome: 'accepted-existing-commit' }. Each case additionally asserts the recorded argv contains no 'commit' and no 'add' invocation after dispatch (Task 5 Done-when 2: no additional engine commit) and that outcome.quarantineRef is undefined. Verify RED first by asserting against the current absence, then GREEN; add only - do not modify or delete the describe.skip legacy suite at :681 or the Task 13 rejection table at :940-987.
**Gate:** prd-audit
**Rationale:** src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts:712 reads correct but has zero active coverage: a repo-wide grep finds 'accepted-existing-commit' and 'verified-no-tree-change' only at src/conductor/src/types/events.ts:19-20 and setup-triage.ts:654,712 and in no test file, because the suite that covered fixSession's accept contract is disabled wholesale at src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts:681 (describe.skip legacy fixSession (pre-#1346)) and the replacement suite at :940 covers rejections only. This is a test-coverage gap under approved architecture, not a design question, and plan Task 5 already owns it (step 1 'Replace/add failing fixSession tests for a provider that changes no Git state and for one or more clean commits that are forward descendants of the original HEAD'; Done-when 2 'A clean forward commit chain returns fixed-pass without an additional engine commit'), with src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts in its Files list - so build, not plan. Class sweep: both accept dispositions share the one branch at :712, so the task covers both rather than only the cited 'accepted-existing-commit', and it adds the 'no additional engine commit' assertion the S2.2 detail records as absent from the real-Git proof at test/acceptance/setup-once-per-worktree.acceptance.test.ts:280. No regression: the task only adds a describe block; the disabled legacy suite at :681 and its superseded-contract comment are left in place (no plan task admits deleting them, and the rejection table at :940-987 delivered by Task 13 is untouched, so its ten-reason coverage survives). Found and excluded: the inline disposition union at setup-triage.ts:654 duplicates SetupRepairDisposition at types/events.ts:17-21 minus 'rejected' - a matched pair that could be derived from one source, but no vocabulary changes here and no plan task admits that production edit.
**Criterion:** S2.1
**Parent task:** 5
**Done when:**
- S2.1 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-prd-audit-rem-s41-1: src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts - in the accept describe added by rem-s21-1, pass the same array-collecting emitter spy used at :969-971 into fixSession and assert per case that exactly one event was emitted, deep-matching { type: 'setup_repair', disposition: 'verified-no-tree-change' | 'accepted-existing-commit', preservedPaths: [] } with quarantineRef undefined and no 'rejected' disposition; then add a third case for Task 12 Done-when 3 - a dirty or unreadable initial porcelain (setup-triage.ts:648-650) returns { kind: 'park', contractOutcome: 'precondition-failed' }, dispatches zero fix sessions, and emits zero events. Verify RED then GREEN; leave the Task 13 rejection-table emitter assertions at :974-987 unchanged.
**Gate:** prd-audit
**Rationale:** The settled latch at src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts:654-656 emits one setup_repair per attempted fix-session, but only two of the four closed dispositions are asserted: the rejection table at src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts:940-987 drives all ten rejection reasons and test/acceptance/bin-setup-quarantines-a-fix-session-s-repair-inste.acceptance.test.ts:148-151 proves the single 'engine-committed' event, while 'verified-no-tree-change' and 'accepted-existing-commit' are asserted by no test (same repo-wide grep as S2.1). Story 4's Done-When requires unit tests over every closed disposition, and plan Task 12 owns it verbatim (step 1 'Add failing emitter-spy cases around the no-change, clean-forward-commit, and exact-engine-commit paths'; Done-when 1 and 3), with setup-triage.test.ts in its Files list - conforming test drift under approved architecture, so build. Class sweep: the uncovered class is the whole accept half of the emitter vocabulary plus Task 12 Done-when 3's zero-emission precondition path, so the task asserts all three sites in one place rather than only the two the audit named; the emitter-spy shape is the same array-collector used at :969-971, reused rather than reinvented. No regression: this task only adds assertions to the accept describe block introduced by rem-s21-1 and adds a precondition case; the existing exactly-one-event assertions in the rejection table and the acceptance test's engine-committed proof are left intact.
**Criterion:** S4.1
**Parent task:** 12
**Done when:**
- S4.1 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-prd-audit-rem-s13-1: src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts:716-720 — replace the single collapsed outputTail 'repair commit postcondition failed' with one distinct named message per postcondition, evaluated in order, keeping contractOutcome 'repair-postcondition-failed' unchanged and adding NO new value to the closed SetupRepairRejectionReason union in src/conductor/src/types/events.ts:17-34: (a) !verified.ok keeps verified.outputTail exactly as today; (b) verified.value.head === original.head => 'repair commit postcondition failed: HEAD did not advance past the original commit'; (c) verified.value.tree !== candidate.value.tree => 'repair commit postcondition failed: committed tree did not match the verified candidate tree'; (d) verified.value.dirty => 'repair commit postcondition failed: worktree left dirty after the repair commit'. Leave the parent check at :719-720 and its 'repair commit parent did not match original HEAD' text intact. In src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts extend the rejectionGit fake (:876) with per-postcondition variants and add a table asserting each of the four families returns { kind: 'park', contractOutcome: 'repair-postcondition-failed' } AND an outputTail naming its own failed check, plus the existing parent-mismatch case. Verify RED first, then GREEN; leave the existing Task 13 rejection table row at :940-987 and the describe.skip legacy suite at :681 unchanged.
**Gate:** prd-audit
**Rationale:** src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts:716-718 collapses four distinct postcondition failures (snapshot unreadable, HEAD did not advance, committed tree != verified candidate tree, worktree left dirty) into the single literal outputTail 'repair commit postcondition failed', while only the parent check at :719-720 names its own failure ('repair commit parent did not match original HEAD'); the sole covering row in the Task 13 table at src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts:957 asserts contractOutcome alone, so nothing pins which check failed. Plan Task 10 owns the repair verbatim (Done-when 2: 'Parent, tree/HEAD, and porcelain mismatches each produce repair-postcondition-failed naming the failed check') and lists both setup-triage.ts and setup-triage.test.ts in its Files, so this is conforming implementation drift inside approved design, not a plan or architecture question. Confidence 95% (verified: both sites read directly this lap). Class sweep: the defect is one collapsed guard, so the task splits every branch of that guard rather than the tree case alone; the sibling reject sites for 'snapshot-failed' at :686,700,710 already pass their own snapshot outputTail through and need no change. Matched pair: the rejection-reason vocabulary is duplicated across SetupRepairRejectionReason (src/conductor/src/types/events.ts:17-34), the test-local RejectionCase union (test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts:858-869), test/engine/event-sinks.test.ts:125 and test/integration/audit-trail-completeness.integration.test.ts:58 — so the task changes only the free-prose outputTail and MUST NOT add a rejection reason, leaving every side of that pair untouched. No regression: contractOutcome 'repair-postcondition-failed' and the existing parent-check message and its Task 13 table row are preserved.
**Criterion:** S1.3
**Parent task:** 10
**Done when:**
- S1.3 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-prd-audit-rem-s34-1: src/conductor/test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts:858-987 — add argv recording to the rejectionGit fake (return { git, calls } or an exposed calls array, mirroring acceptedRepairGit at :985) and extend the RejectionCase union AND the cases table together (they are a matched pair) with two new preservation faults driving setup-triage.ts:629-633: (a) ref-refresh failure — git ['branch','-f','wip/setup-quarantine-<slug>',<attemptedHead>] exits 1 over an already-existing ref; (b) ref-verification failure — git ['rev-parse','--verify',ref] exits 0 but returns a SHA different from the attempted head. Assert for each: outcome { kind: 'park', contractOutcome: 'preservation-failed' }, exactly one emitted setup_repair with disposition 'rejected' and reason 'preservation-failed', outcome.quarantineRef and the event's quarantineRef both undefined (a pre-existing older ref is never reported as proof of the current attempt), an outputTail naming ref-refresh vs ref-verification respectively, and zero ['reset','--hard',<originalHead>] entries in the recorded argv. Also assert on the existing restoration-failed row that the refreshed ref still resolves to the attempted head after the reset fault, closing Task 11's fourth fault case. Add no value to SetupRepairRejectionReason; keep the existing git-add preservation-failed row and all other table rows unchanged. Verify RED first (the two new rows fail against today's fake), then GREEN.
**Gate:** prd-audit
**Rationale:** src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts:629-633 handles both ref faults correctly — a non-zero `git branch -f` and a `rev-parse --verify` whose SHA differs from the attempted head each return { ok: false, restored: false }, so :672 reports preservation-failed with no ref and the `reset --hard` at :634 is never reached — but no test drives either: the sole preservation-failed row fails `git add` instead (test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts:919-920), 'branch' returns success unconditionally (:927) and 'rev-parse --verify' always returns the attempted head (:933), and rejectionGit records no argv so zero-reset cannot be asserted. Story 3 Done-When 2 requires fault injection at ref refresh and reset, and plan Task 11 step 1 names 'force-refresh failure over an existing ref' and 'ref-verification failure' as two of its four faults with setup-triage.test.ts in its Files list — test-only work under approved architecture. Confidence 90% (verified: code path and coverage absence both read this lap; the defect is missing coverage, not observed misbehavior). Class sweep: Task 11 step 1 enumerates four faults and only the residue-commit one is driven today, so this task adds both ref faults AND pins the fourth (reset-hard after a verified ref) by asserting the refreshed ref still resolves to the attempted head on the restoration-failed row, rather than leaving it for the next lap. Matched pair: the test-local RejectionCase union (:858-869) and the cases table (:940-957) are two lists that must agree — the task extends them together; no production rejection reason is added, so events.ts, event-sinks.test.ts and the audit-trail fixture stay untouched. No regression: the existing git-add preservation-failed row and every other Task 13 row are kept as-is; the argv recorder is added to rejectionGit inside this task (the accepted-path fake at :985 already records calls; rejectionGit does not, and no other remediation task supplies it).
**Criterion:** S3.4
**Parent task:** 11
**Done when:**
- S3.4 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-prd-audit-rem-s44-1: src/conductor/test/acceptance/bin-setup-quarantines-a-fix-session-s-repair-inste.acceptance.test.ts — add the negative acceptance case Story 4 Done-When 3 and plan Task 14 Done-when 2 require, covering BOTH silent paths over the same real-local-Git fixture used at :56-74: (a) ordinary setup success — prepare succeeds on the first attempt so triage never reaches fixSession; (b) stage-1-only recovery — quarantine plus retryPrepareAfterQuarantine (src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts:509-556) succeeds without a fix session. For each assert zero setup_repair records in the feature's persisted .pipeline/events.jsonl (read and parse the file, filter type === 'setup_repair'), zero fix-session dispatches, and zero rendered 'setup repair' daemon lines. Assert at the persisted-events layer, not only against an injected emitter spy. Verify RED by temporarily emitting a setup_repair from runTriage, then remove that probe and verify GREEN. Add only — leave the engine-committed case at :75-152 and the provider-failure no-state case at :154-219 untouched.
**Gate:** prd-audit
**Rationale:** The silence holds structurally — setup_repair is emitted only from fixSession's two settlement sites at src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts:655 and :674, and neither runTriage nor retryPrepareAfterQuarantine (:509,556) accepts an emitter — but nothing asserts it: setup_repair appears in six test files (event-sink-registry.test.ts, event-sinks.test.ts, audit-trail-completeness.integration.test.ts, setup-triage.test.ts, the red-runner, and the #1346 acceptance test) and none asserts its absence on an ordinary-setup or stage-1-only path; the feature acceptance test proves only the positive record at :143-151, and test/engine/daemon-cli-setup-triage.test.ts:281 calls fixSession without an emitter while asserting nothing about events. Story 4 Done-When 3 states the obligation directly and plan Task 14 owns it (step 1: 'ordinary setup/stage-1-only recovery produces no setup_repair record'; Done-when 2 repeats it) with the acceptance test in its Files list — test-only work under approved design. Confidence 95% (verified: emit sites and the test-wide grep both re-checked this lap). Class sweep: the silent-path class is exactly the two non-fixSession entry points, so the task covers both in one block, and asserts silence at the persisted .pipeline/events.jsonl layer (the operator-visible surface Task 14 Done-when 2 names) rather than only at an injected emitter spy, so an emitter later added inside runTriage or retryPrepareAfterQuarantine is caught. No regression: the task adds a case only — the engine-committed persistence/render assertions at :75-152 and the Task 15 provider-failure no-state case at :154-219 are left unchanged.
**Criterion:** S4.4
**Parent task:** 14
**Done when:**
- S4.4 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-prd-audit-rem-s42-1: src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-runner.ts:691-700 — add a fourth branch before the final else, for a ref-less park whose contractOutcome is 'preservation-failed': state that no quarantine ref was created because preserving the attempted repair failed, that the attempted state was therefore NOT restored and is still in the worktree on the feature branch, and that the operator must inspect and clear it before unparking — never the clean-HEAD claim. Keep the other three branches byte-identical, including the verbatim 'No quarantine ref exists (clean-HEAD case)' string still reached by every other ref-less park, and add NO value to SetupRepairRejectionReason in src/conductor/src/types/events.ts:17-34 (compare against the existing member only). Tests: extend the existing with/without-quarantine HALT case in src/conductor/test/engine/daemon-runner.test.ts:315-366 with a third worktree whose triageEvidence is { kind: 'park', outputTail: 'could not preserve rejected repair ref: ...', contractOutcome: 'preservation-failed', preservedPaths: [] } — [] is the shape reject() actually produces on this path (setup-triage.ts:674 leaves paths empty), so the new sentence is the only evidence the operator gets — asserting the HALT contains it and 'Contract outcome: preservation-failed' and does NOT contain 'No quarantine ref exists (clean-HEAD case)'; leave the existing clean-head-contract-failed assertions at :361-363 unchanged. Add the operator-visible proof in src/conductor/test/acceptance/bin-setup-quarantines-a-fix-session-s-repair-inste.acceptance.test.ts as a real-local-Git case whose fix session leaves residue and whose 'git branch -f' fails, asserting the persisted .pipeline/HALT names the preservation failure, omits the clean-HEAD wording, and that the residue is still present in the worktree; leave the engine-committed case (:76-152) and the Task 15 provider-failure case (:154-219) untouched. Verify RED first (both new assertions fail on the clean-HEAD wording today), then GREEN.
**Gate:** prd-audit
**Rationale:** src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-runner.ts:691-700 renders the triage ref line as a three-way branch: a quarantineRef prints 'Quarantine ref: ...' (:692); a provider-failure whose treeUnchangedSinceDispatch.before === .after prints the Task 15 no-state sentence (:697); everything else falls through to 'No quarantine ref exists (clean-HEAD case)' at :699. A preservation-failed rejection reaches that fallback: src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts:620,623,626,628,631,633,635,637 each return { ok: false, restored: false } BEFORE the 'reset --hard <original>' at :640, and reject() at :674 therefore sets finalReason='preservation-failed' with ref undefined and paths [] while the provider's commits and/or residue are deliberately still in the worktree — so the HALT asserts a clean HEAD, and prints no 'Dirty paths' block either, in exactly the state where neither is true. Confidence 97% (verified this lap: the fallback branch, all eight ref-less preservation returns, reject()'s else-branch at :674, and zero 'preservation-failed' hits in test/engine/daemon-runner.test.ts and zero 'setup_repair' hits in test/engine/daemon-render.test.ts were each read or grepped directly). Route: conforming implementation/test drift inside approved architecture — plan Task 14 Done-when 2 owns the repair verbatim ('A rejected HALT names its reason, current quarantine ref/paths when present, or the preservation failure when absent') and Task 15 already admits daemon-runner.ts as the HALT-rendering surface for this exact fallback, so no plan or architecture question remains. Class sweep: the class is 'a ref-less triage park whose worktree is NOT clean reaches the clean-HEAD fallback'. Members: preservation-failed (closed by rem-s42-1). Found and excluded: precondition-failed (setup-triage.ts:655-656, returned when the INITIAL worktree is already dirty) reaches the same fallback and is likewise not clean-HEAD, but no plan task admits repairing its HALT wording — Task 12 owns only its zero-emission behavior and Task 14 Done-when 2 speaks only of the preservation failure — so it is recorded here rather than quietly fixed. Not in the class: restoration-failed always carries a ref (setup-triage.ts:640,673), and setup-still-failing runs with preserve=false so its tree is genuinely unchanged. Matched pair: 'preservation-failed' is an existing member of the closed SetupRepairRejectionReason union at src/conductor/src/types/events.ts:17-34, mirrored by the test-local RejectionCase union at test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts:858-869, test/engine/event-sinks.test.ts:125 and test/integration/audit-trail-completeness.integration.test.ts:58; the tasks compare against the existing member and add no new value, so no side of that pair moves. No regression: all three existing branches and the verbatim 'No quarantine ref exists (clean-HEAD case)' string stay, preserving Task 15's coverage (acceptance test:273-286) and the generic no-ref park assertion delivered under Task 14 at test/engine/daemon-runner.test.ts:361-363.
**Criterion:** S4.2

**Done when:**
- S4.2 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-prd-audit-rem-s42-2: src/conductor/test/engine/daemon-render.test.ts — add the renderer cases plan Task 2 step 1 called for and that no test currently covers for the 'setup_repair' switch case at src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts:2201-2207 (grepped this lap: zero 'setup_repair' occurrences in that file): one case per success disposition ('engine-committed', 'accepted-existing-commit', 'verified-no-tree-change') asserting a single rendered line naming that disposition, plus a rejected event asserting the line carries its closed reason and, when present, the quarantine ref, and a second rejected event WITHOUT a ref (reason 'preservation-failed') asserting no ref is invented and no separator is emitted (Task 2 Done-when 2). Assert via the file's existing lines(event) helper with chalk.level=0, exactly as every other case in that file does; change no production code (the switch case already exists) and leave every existing render case unchanged. Verify RED first, then GREEN.
**Gate:** prd-audit
**Rationale:** src/conductor/src/engine/daemon-runner.ts:691-700 renders the triage ref line as a three-way branch: a quarantineRef prints 'Quarantine ref: ...' (:692); a provider-failure whose treeUnchangedSinceDispatch.before === .after prints the Task 15 no-state sentence (:697); everything else falls through to 'No quarantine ref exists (clean-HEAD case)' at :699. A preservation-failed rejection reaches that fallback: src/conductor/src/engine/setup-triage.ts:620,623,626,628,631,633,635,637 each return { ok: false, restored: false } BEFORE the 'reset --hard <original>' at :640, and reject() at :674 therefore sets finalReason='preservation-failed' with ref undefined and paths [] while the provider's commits and/or residue are deliberately still in the worktree — so the HALT asserts a clean HEAD, and prints no 'Dirty paths' block either, in exactly the state where neither is true. Confidence 97% (verified this lap: the fallback branch, all eight ref-less preservation returns, reject()'s else-branch at :674, and zero 'preservation-failed' hits in test/engine/daemon-runner.test.ts and zero 'setup_repair' hits in test/engine/daemon-render.test.ts were each read or grepped directly). Route: conforming implementation/test drift inside approved architecture — plan Task 14 Done-when 2 owns the repair verbatim ('A rejected HALT names its reason, current quarantine ref/paths when present, or the preservation failure when absent') and Task 15 already admits daemon-runner.ts as the HALT-rendering surface for this exact fallback, so no plan or architecture question remains. Class sweep: the class is 'a ref-less triage park whose worktree is NOT clean reaches the clean-HEAD fallback'. Members: preservation-failed (closed by rem-s42-1). Found and excluded: precondition-failed (setup-triage.ts:655-656, returned when the INITIAL worktree is already dirty) reaches the same fallback and is likewise not clean-HEAD, but no plan task admits repairing its HALT wording — Task 12 owns only its zero-emission behavior and Task 14 Done-when 2 speaks only of the preservation failure — so it is recorded here rather than quietly fixed. Not in the class: restoration-failed always carries a ref (setup-triage.ts:640,673), and setup-still-failing runs with preserve=false so its tree is genuinely unchanged. Matched pair: 'preservation-failed' is an existing member of the closed SetupRepairRejectionReason union at src/conductor/src/types/events.ts:17-34, mirrored by the test-local RejectionCase union at test/engine/setup-triage.test.ts:858-869, test/engine/event-sinks.test.ts:125 and test/integration/audit-trail-completeness.integration.test.ts:58; the tasks compare against the existing member and add no new value, so no side of that pair moves. No regression: all three existing branches and the verbatim 'No quarantine ref exists (clean-HEAD case)' string stay, preserving Task 15's coverage (acceptance test:273-286) and the generic no-ref park assertion delivered under Task 14 at test/engine/daemon-runner.test.ts:361-363.
