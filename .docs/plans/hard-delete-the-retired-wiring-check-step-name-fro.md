# Implementation Plan: Hard-delete the retired wiring_check step name

**Date:** 2026-08-26
**Stories:** .docs/stories/hard-delete-the-retired-wiring-check-step-name-fro.md
**Conflict check:** Clean as of 2026-08-26

## Summary

Deletes the retired `wiring_check` step name from the engine (registry, group, events, config,
policy, model table), re-anchors the BUILD verification semantics the dead fan-out lane carried
onto the serial dispatch path, and proves historical state stays loadable. 13 tasks.

## Technical Approach

`'wiring_check'` is a `StepName` union member (`src/conductor/src/types/steps.ts:18`); removing it
fans out compile errors through every exhaustive `Record<StepName, …>` and literal comparison, so
Task 1 is one atomic deletion across all compile-coupled sites, ending green. The `deprecated`
StepDefinition field and the `deprecated_step` event lose their only user and are deleted
separately (Task 2, with their `EVENT_SINKS` key — the sink registry is exhaustive and rejects
orphans).

`BUILD_VERIFICATION_GROUP` is dissolved, not kept one-member: the executor's width-1 guard
(`src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:6064`, `dispatchable.length > 1`) makes a one-member group
unreachable dead structure (amended adr-2026-07-29). Dissolving it kills the lane that implemented
two load-bearing semantics, which Tasks 6–7 re-anchor on the serial dispatch path
(`conductor.ts:7916+`): post-repair re-verification of a `done` `test_suite`
(`reverifyDoneBuildMembers`, `conductor.ts:6026-6028`; adr-2026-08-03) and deterministic-failure
gate-repair recording + single kickback-budget charge (`conductor.ts:6387-6503`; amended
adr-2026-07-29 point 4). The mechanism is decided here: port the existing
`recordDeterministicGateRepair` + `consumeKickbackBudget` calls (reuse the same functions, not
re-implementations) into the serial `test_suite` failure handling beside
`retainedFullSuiteFailure`, and gate serial dispatch eligibility of a `done` `test_suite` on the
same `buildRepairVerificationPending` flag the lane consulted.

Historical readability needs no new machinery — state reads are untyped and registry-driven
(`readState` validates nothing; `findResumeIndex` iterates the registry, `conductor.ts:11921-11946`)
— so Task 9 pins that property with fixtures rather than adding code. The daemon-cli renderer's
closed member match degrades legacy events to a labeled fallback (Task 10). A leftover consumer
`steps.wiring_check:` block classifies as a custom-step declaration and fails config load by the
existing path (`src/conductor/src/engine/config.ts:550,657-659`) — pinned by test, no new code
(operator decision: no special diagnostic).

Local pattern context for the acceptance tests (Tasks 6, 7, 8, 13): follow the existing
engine-orchestration acceptance tests that drive a fake-provider conductor through BUILD and
assert on emitted events and `.pipeline/` state — e.g. the deterministic-verification flow test
(search `test/acceptance/` for `deterministic-build-verification` and `full-suite`). Traits to
preserve: real engine flow, faithful fakes at the provider boundary, assertions on events +
gate/ledger files, no real LLM calls. Variation allowed: helper setup and fixture shape.

## Prerequisites

- Architecture review approved with conditions C1–C5; ADR amendments to adr-2026-08-14 and
  adr-2026-07-29 committed (already in this spec's baseline).
- PR body must carry a `## Migration` bash fence removing `steps.wiring_check` blocks from
  consumer configs (consumer-visible break; not a plan task — release-gate contract).
- Landing note (C5): merge after the in-flight worktrees whose `conduct-state.json` names the
  step have shipped or been reset — hygiene only; Task 9 proves resume is safe regardless.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Delete the wiring_check name from all compile-coupled engine sites
**Story:** 1
**Type:** refactor

**Steps:**
1. Remove `'wiring_check'` from the `StepName` union (`src/conductor/src/types/steps.ts:18`).
2. Chase every compile error to a deletion, per /code-removal (survivor behavior is owned by later
   tasks' tests): registry entry `src/conductor/src/engine/steps.ts:155-167`; `build_review`
   prerequisites → `['test_suite']` (`steps.ts:189`); `BUILD_VERIFICATION_GROUP` definition and
   its `STEP_GROUPS` registration (`steps.ts:346-353,375`) plus the now-dead
   `builtinGroup.name === BUILD_VERIFICATION_GROUP.name` branches and import in
   `src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts` (`:131,6026-6028,6120-6136,6354-6385,6387-6503`);
   serial arm + `runWiringCheckStep` (`conductor.ts:7916-7917,10934-10941`); step-runner guard
   (`src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts:738-743`); artifact contract key + completion
   predicate (`src/conductor/src/engine/artifacts.ts:298,3343-3345`); exhaustive config/policy/
   metadata keys (`src/conductor/src/engine/resolved-config.ts:50,81`,
   `src/conductor/src/engine/provider-model-policy.ts:49,78,107`,
   `src/conductor/src/engine/model-table-metadata.ts:5-10,23,50`); events member unions →
   `'test_suite'` (`src/conductor/src/types/events.ts:685,696`); daemon-cli renderer arm →
   fallback label (`src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts:2360-2361`).
3. Grep pass over the non-exhaustive `Partial<Record<StepName, …>>` maps for quoted leftovers:
   `src/conductor/src/engine/gate-verdicts.ts`, `src/conductor/src/engine/skill-invocation.ts`,
   `src/conductor/src/engine/selector.ts`, `src/conductor/src/ui/dashboard-snapshot.ts`.
4. `npx tsc --noEmit` for the conductor package passes.
5. Commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes with `'wiring_check'` absent from the `StepName` union
- [ ] `grep -rn "wiring_check" src/conductor/src` returns zero hits (the closed enumeration for "complete excision" at the engine-source surface; tests/docs are later tasks)
- [ ] `build_review`'s prerequisites are exactly `['test_suite']` and `STEP_GROUPS` contains only the SHIP validation group

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/types/steps.ts — union member removed
- src/conductor/src/engine/steps.ts — registry entry, prerequisites, group
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — group branches, serial arm, runWiringCheckStep
- src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts — retired-step guard
- src/conductor/src/engine/artifacts.ts — contract key, predicate
- src/conductor/src/engine/resolved-config.ts — default retries/review keys
- src/conductor/src/engine/provider-model-policy.ts — model/effort keys
- src/conductor/src/engine/model-table-metadata.ts — rationale + model-free entries
- src/conductor/src/types/events.ts — member unions
- src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts — renderer arm

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 2: Delete the orphaned deprecated-step machinery
**Story:** 1
**Type:** refactor

**Steps:**
1. Delete the `deprecated?: { adr: string }` field (`src/conductor/src/types/steps.ts:108`) and
   the `step.deprecated` suppression branch (`src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:7401-7407`).
2. Delete the `deprecated_step` `ConductorEvent` variant and its `EVENT_SINKS` key in the same
   commit (exhaustive sink registry, adr-2026-07-26 — an orphan key fails compile).
3. `tsc --noEmit` passes; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` passes with no `deprecated` field on `StepDefinition`, no `deprecated_step` event variant, and no `deprecated_step` sink key
- [ ] `grep -rn "deprecated_step" src/conductor/src` returns zero hits

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/types/steps.ts — field removed
- src/conductor/src/types/events.ts — event variant removed
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — suppression branch removed
- src/conductor/src/engine/event-sinks.ts — sink key removed (locate by `EVENT_SINKS` definition)

**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Task 3: Update the rebase invalidation set
**Story:** 5
**Type:** refactor

**Steps:**
1. Remove `wiring_check` from the `applyRebaseVerdicts` invalidation set (locate in
   `src/conductor/src/engine/` by `applyRebaseVerdicts`; adr-2026-07-20 refines this invariant).
2. Update the directly-affected unit test(s) for the invalidation set to the surviving members.
3. Run those tests green; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] The invalidation-set unit tests pass naming only surviving steps
- [ ] `grep -n "wiring_check"` over the invalidation module returns zero hits

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/rebase-verdicts.ts — invalidation set (locate by `applyRebaseVerdicts`)
- test/ — the invalidation set's unit tests

**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Task 4: Sweep the test suite
**Story:** 1
**Type:** refactor

**Steps:**
1. `grep -rln wiring_check test/` (~80 files). For each: delete tests whose subject was the
   retired step's own behavior (the no-op run, the group fan-out with two members, the retired
   guard); rewrite tests that exercise surviving behavior (group core, join, kickback, resume) to
   the `test_suite`-only topology. Fixtures used by Task 9 keep their `wiring_check` residue —
   they exist to prove historical loads.
2. Run the full default suite green; commit (split into a few commits by area if large).

**Done when:**
- [ ] Default test suite passes
- [ ] `grep -rln "wiring_check" test/` matches only fixtures exercised by the Task 9 historical-load tests (closed enumeration recorded in that test file)

**Files likely touched:**
- test/ — sweep (wiring-gate-loop.test.ts, deterministic-build-verification acceptance, model-table-metadata.test.ts, others per grep)

**Dependencies:** Task 1, Task 2, Task 3

### Task 5: Regenerate the model table
**Story:** 1
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Run `bin/generate-model-table`; commit the regenerated HARNESS.md generated section.
2. Run `test/test_harness_integrity.sh`; fix any 5a/5b drift it names.

**Done when:**
- [ ] `test/test_harness_integrity.sh` passes, including check 5a
- [ ] The generated HARNESS.md table contains no `wiring_check` row

**Files likely touched:**
- HARNESS.md — regenerated table section

**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Task 6: Re-anchor post-repair re-verification of test_suite on the serial path (C1)
**Story:** 4
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing acceptance test (pattern: deterministic-verification flow tests, see Technical
   Approach): build completes → `test_suite` green → build repair occurs → on resume,
   `test_suite` re-executes against the repaired tree (evidence recomputed, not reused) before
   `build_review` dispatches; a failing re-run blocks `build_review` (Story 4 negative paths).
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: gate serial dispatch of a `done` `test_suite` on the same
   `buildRepairVerificationPending` signal the deleted lane consulted
   (`reverifyDoneBuildMembers` semantics); evidence reuse refusal rides the existing
   tree-anchored evidence check.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Acceptance test passes: repair → test_suite re-runs → build_review only after green re-run
- [ ] Acceptance test passes: pre-repair test_suite evidence is not reused after a repair (recomputed evidence observed)
- [ ] Acceptance test passes: failing re-run blocks build_review dispatch

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — serial test_suite eligibility after repair
- test/acceptance/ — new acceptance test

**Dependencies:** Task 4

### Task 7: Re-anchor deterministic-failure classification and budget on the serial path (C2)
**Story:** 3
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing acceptance test: deterministic `test_suite` failure on the serial path →
   `recordDeterministicGateRepair` record written for `test_suite`, kickback budget charged
   exactly once, `build_review` not dispatched; then a fixing tree change → re-run green →
   feature proceeds and the ledger shows reset-on-progress.
2. Verify RED (or document GREEN if the serial path already routes through the same calls —
   then this task's implementation step is dropped and the test pins the equivalence).
3. Implement if RED: port the `recordDeterministicGateRepair` + `consumeKickbackBudget` calls
   from the deleted lane (`conductor.ts:6387-6503` pre-deletion) into the serial `test_suite`
   failure handling beside `retainedFullSuiteFailure` — reuse the same functions.
4. Verify GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Acceptance test passes: single budget charge + gate-repair record per deterministic failure
- [ ] Acceptance test passes: unchanged repeated failure reaches the existing per-gate cap halt naming `test_suite`
- [ ] Acceptance test passes: tree-changed re-run resets the count per the ledger's made-progress rule

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — serial failure classification
- test/acceptance/ — new acceptance test

**Dependencies:** Task 4

### Task 8: Preserve the infrastructure-failure class for the suite
**Story:** 3
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing (or pinning) test: `test_suite` infrastructure failure (suite could not run —
   e.g. runner spawn failure) on the serial path is not charged as a semantic kickback and the
   failure class is preserved in the emitted event/halt output.
2. Verify, implement if needed (same classification taxonomy the aggregate verifier already
   emits — reuse, don't re-derive), GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Test passes: infra failure produces no kickback-budget charge (kickback ledger count for `test_suite` unchanged by the run)
- [ ] Test passes: the emitted event/halt output carries the infrastructure failure class, not the deterministic-failure class

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — failure-class routing (if any change needed)
- test/ — the test

**Dependencies:** Task 7

### Task 9: Pin historical-state loadability with fixtures (C3)
**Story:** 5
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Add committed fixtures (or reuse the two existing stale-key state fixtures under
   `test/fixtures/rebase-invalidated-test-suite-proof-halts-build-review/`): a
   `conduct-state.json` with `wiring_check: done`, `build_verification__wiring_check: done`, and
   `last_step: wiring_check`; a `kickback-ledger.json` with a `gates.wiring_check` entry; an
   `events.jsonl` with `parallel_started` branches naming `wiring_check` and a
   `parallel:wiring_check` execution key; a `.pipeline/gates/wiring_check.json` verdict file.
2. Write tests: state loads and resume derives its index from the registry walk without error;
   ledger loads with other gates honored; event log renders/rolls up without crashing; orphan
   verdict file affects no gate decision.
3. GREEN (expected — reads are untyped); commit. This task pins behavior; if any load throws,
   fix the reader to be lenient at that site.

**Done when:**
- [ ] All four fixture-load tests pass
- [ ] The test file enumerates the fixture paths (the closed list Task 4's grep check references)

**Files likely touched:**
- test/ — historical-load tests + fixtures

**Dependencies:** Task 4

### Task 10: Legacy member events render with a labeled fallback
**Story:** 5
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write test: a persisted `build_member_evidence_reused` event with `member: 'wiring_check'`
   (as raw JSON, bypassing the narrowed type) renders through the daemon-cli renderer as the
   existing labeled unknown-member fallback, not a crash.
2. Verify against the Task 1 renderer change; GREEN; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Renderer test passes: legacy member value renders as the labeled fallback string
- [ ] Renderer test passes: a current `member: 'test_suite'` event still renders with its member name

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts — renderer (if adjustment needed)
- test/ — renderer test

**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Task 11: Leftover consumer config fails the ordinary custom-step way
**Story:** 6
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write test: config with `steps: { wiring_check: { max_retries: 2 } }` fails `loadConfig` with
   the existing custom-step validation error naming `wiring_check` (missing `after:`); and a
   config naming any other undeclared step fails with the identical shape.
2. GREEN (expected from Task 1 — the name leaves `builtInNames`); commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Config test passes: `steps.wiring_check` block → custom-step error naming `wiring_check`, non-zero load failure
- [ ] Config test passes: another undeclared step name fails with the same error shape

**Files likely touched:**
- test/ — config validation test

**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Task 12: Operator-supplied unknown step names fail by name
**Story:** 1
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write test: `rewind --to wiring_check` (through the mutation-port validation path,
   adr-2026-08-19) fails by name against the resolved registry with an error naming
   `wiring_check`, mutating nothing.
2. GREEN (expected — registry validation already exists); commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Rewind test passes: unknown-step error names `wiring_check` and exits non-zero
- [ ] Rewind test passes: the state file bytes are unchanged after the refused rewind

**Files likely touched:**
- test/ — rewind validation test

**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Task 13: Pin the surviving BUILD verification topology
**Story:** 2
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write acceptance test (pattern per Technical Approach): full BUILD flow — after `build`,
   `test_suite` executes and `build_review` dispatches only on its green result; no
   `parallel_started` event for a BUILD verification group is emitted; a deterministic
   `test_suite` failure blocks `build_review` with no review dispatch; a mid-verification engine
   restart resumes at the correct step.
2. GREEN against Tasks 1–7; commit.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Acceptance test passes: build → test_suite → build_review ordering with zero `build_verification` group events in the emitted stream
- [ ] Acceptance test passes: failing suite yields no build_review dispatch
- [ ] Acceptance test passes: restart mid-verification resumes without error

**Files likely touched:**
- test/acceptance/ — topology acceptance test

**Dependencies:** Task 6, Task 7

### Task 14: Canonical docs sweep — the retired step name leaves reader-facing pages (C4)
**Story:** Story 1
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Enumerate the surviving references: `git grep -n "wiring_check" -- docs/ HARNESS.md README.md` — nine pages carry them (`HARNESS.md`, `docs/explanation/gates.md`, `docs/guides/running-the-daemon.md`, `docs/reference/artifacts.md`, `docs/reference/configuration.md`, `docs/reference/models.md`, `docs/reference/skills.md`, `docs/reference/steps.md`, `docs/runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md`). Re-run the grep rather than trusting this list.
2. Rewrite each reference to describe the surviving topology: the BUILD verification group has one member, `test_suite`; `wiring_check` no longer exists as a step name, a gate key, a model-table row, or a parallel execution key.
3. Where a page documents recovery or configuration keyed on the retired name (`docs/runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md`, `docs/reference/configuration.md`), describe what an operator with a leftover `steps.wiring_check` entry now sees — the ordinary unknown-custom-step failure Task 11 pins — rather than deleting the guidance outright.
4. Leave deliberate historical mentions intact only where the page is describing a past state (an ADR quote, a changelog line); every present-tense claim that the step exists is a defect.
5. Verify: `git grep -n "wiring_check" -- docs/ HARNESS.md README.md` returns only historical-context lines, each identifiable as such.
6. Commit: "docs: remove the retired wiring_check step from the canonical pages".

**Done when:**
- [ ] No page under `docs/`, plus `HARNESS.md` and `README.md`, describes `wiring_check` as an existing step, gate, model-table row, or execution key.
- [ ] `docs/reference/steps.md` and `docs/explanation/gates.md` describe the BUILD verification group as single-member (`test_suite`).
- [ ] Every surviving occurrence of the string is a past-tense historical reference, enumerated in the commit message.
- [ ] `test/test_harness_integrity.sh` passes, including the model-table check (5a).

**Files likely touched:**
- HARNESS.md; docs/explanation/gates.md; docs/guides/running-the-daemon.md; docs/reference/artifacts.md; docs/reference/configuration.md; docs/reference/models.md; docs/reference/skills.md; docs/reference/steps.md; docs/runbooks/stalled-or-stuck-feature.md

**Dependencies:** Task 5

## Integration Points

- After Task 4: engine compiles and the default suite is green on the test_suite-only topology.
- After Task 7: the full deterministic-verification semantics (C1 + C2) are live and tested.
- After Task 13: end-to-end BUILD flow pinned.

## Verification

- [ ] All happy path criteria covered by at least one task
- [ ] All negative path criteria covered by at least one task
- [ ] No task exceeds 5 minutes of work (Task 1 and 4 are mechanical compile-chases; split
      commits allowed)
- [ ] Every task has a `Done when:` block of falsifiable checks; "complete excision" is closed by
      the grep enumerations in Tasks 1 and 4
- [ ] Dependencies are explicit and acyclic

### Task rem-as-built-rem-adr-001: RED test for the missing BUILD round-outcome emit: add a test (do not modify or relax any existing assertion) asserting runTestSuiteStep emits build_member_evidence_reused {member:'test_suite',decision:'reuse',basis:'fingerprint-match'} when FullSuiteVerifier.ensure() returns REUSED, and build_member_evidence_recomputed {member:'test_suite',decision:'recompute',basis:'fingerprint-mismatch'} when ensure() returns EXECUTED with freshness.reason==='fingerprint_mismatch' plus basis 'fresh-evidence-required' for any other FullSuiteStaleReason (src/conductor/src/engine/full-suite-verifier.ts:33-49,52-58); follow the existing emitted-event assertion pattern in src/conductor/test/engine/ and assert the FAILED and unexpected-status early returns still emit neither event
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** Conforming implementation drift, not an architecture change: APPROVED ADR decision 5 (.docs/decisions/adr-2026-08-03-build-repair-member-reuse-validity.md:175-180) requires each BUILD-verification member to settle its round with an event naming the member, the reuse/recompute decision, and the basis, and the retained contract is intact on all three consumer sides (union src/conductor/src/types/events.ts:672-695, sink registry src/conductor/src/engine/event-sinks.ts:86-87, daemon renderer src/conductor/src/daemon-cli.ts:2348-2370) -- only the producer was lost with the deleted group path, so runTestSuiteStep (src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:11107-11142) returns REUSED/EXECUTED evidence without emitting either variant. Verified 99%: a repo-wide grep for build_member_evidence across src/conductor/src outside those three declaration sites returns zero hits, confirming a single missing producer site. Sweep: test_suite is the sole surviving BUILD-verification member and both event variants are narrowed to member:'test_suite', so no sibling producer site exists; the union, sink registry, and renderer already agree and are read, not edited, by these tasks, so no matched pair is split and no existing code, test, or assertion is removed or relaxed. Plan-task coverage: Task 6 (re-anchor post-repair re-verification of test_suite on the serial path, C1) and Task 13 (pin the surviving BUILD verification topology) admit this repair, so no plan-scope growth beyond them is required. Found and deliberately excluded: (a) the Drift Notes PLAN_GAP -- thirty canonical-docs references to the retired step across nine files (HARNESS.md:57, docs/reference/steps.md:55-67,149-150, docs/explanation/gates.md:128,171-172) -- is not in the Blocking Findings table, did not drive the gate verdict (.pipeline/gates/architecture_review_as_built.json cites only the BLOCKED as-built verdict), no approved plan task 1-13 admits a docs sweep, and the reviewer explicitly routes it to the plan rather than to BUILD; (b) the non-structural diagram note at .docs/architecture/hard-delete-the-retired-wiring-check-step-name-fro.md:64-66, which still calls group dissolution undecided, is likewise a non-blocking drift note on a sealed feature artifact. Neither is fixed by these tasks.
**Governing clause:** adr-2026-08-03-build-repair-member-reuse-validity decision 5
**Done when:**
- adr-2026-08-03-build-repair-member-reuse-validity decision 5 is satisfied by this task.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-adr-002: src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:11107-11142 -- in runTestSuiteStep, after the REUSED/EXECUTED verdict is accepted and before the success return, await this.events.emit of the retained round-outcome event: REUSED -> {type:'build_member_evidence_reused',member:'test_suite',decision:'reuse',basis:'fingerprint-match'}; EXECUTED -> {type:'build_member_evidence_recomputed',member:'test_suite',decision:'recompute',basis: verification.freshness.reason === 'fingerprint_mismatch' ?

Found and deliberately excluded: (a) the Drift Notes PLAN_GAP -- thirty canonical-docs references to the retired step across nine files (HARNESS.md:57, docs/reference/steps.md:55-67,149-150, docs/explanation/gates.md:128,171-172) -- is not in the Blocking Findings table, did not drive the gate verdict (.pipeline/gates/architecture_review_as_built.json cites only the BLOCKED as-built verdict), no approved plan task 1-13 admits a docs sweep, and the reviewer explicitly routes it to the plan rather than to BUILD; (b) the non-structural diagram note at .docs/architecture/hard-delete-the-retired-wiring-check-step-name-fro.md:64-66, which still calls group dissolution undecided, is likewise a non-blocking drift note on a sealed feature artifact. Neither is fixed by these tasks.
