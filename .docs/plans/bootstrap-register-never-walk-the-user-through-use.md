# Implementation Plan: Guided setup walks the operator through project and operator configuration

**Date:** 2026-09-14
**Design:** .docs/specs/bootstrap-register-never-walk-the-user-through-use.md
**Stories:** .docs/stories/bootstrap-register-never-walk-the-user-through-use.md
**Conflict check:** Clean as of 2026-09-14
**Source:** jstoup111/ai-conductor#2218

## Summary

Extends the two existing deterministic config writers by one input each and grows the bootstrap skill's Step 1b-i into a guided interview, in 16 tasks. No new module, no new CLI verb, no runtime config-load change.

## Technical Approach

- **Skill asks, engine writes (adr-2026-08-28 D8, new D9).** `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` Step 1b-i becomes a per-setting interview; every answer is recorded through one `ai-conductor config init` invocation carrying flags. The skill never edits `.ai-conductor/config.yml` (adr-2026-07-27 decision 3).
- **One new `config init` flag: `--test-suite-command`.** Parsed in `detectRegistryCommand`, validated in `resolveVerificationSelection`, substituted by `renderVerificationBlock` at the existing single template anchor, replacing the hardcoded `npm test` literal. Flagless output keeps its pre-change effective settings and non-comment lines, pinned by a committed pre-change fixture; only comment or blank lines are added. Local pattern to follow: the D8 flags in `src/conductor/src/engine/registry-cli.ts` — typed option carried into `runConfigInit`, closed-vocabulary validation before any write, single-anchor substitution, `already-exists` refusal untouched; allowed variation: the command is free text, so validation is shape-only (non-empty, single line). Rediscover via symbols `detectRegistryCommand`, `ConfigInitOptions`, `resolveVerificationSelection`, `renderVerificationBlock`, `TEST_SUITE_VERIFICATION_TEMPLATE_ANCHOR`.
- **One new `config set` path: `spec_owner` (adr-2026-08-09 decision 6).** `userConfigSetCommand` in `src/conductor/src/cli.ts` accepts exactly this additional top-level path, validated through `validateConfig` on the user source, written by the existing atomic `writeUserConfig`. It never targets a project file, so adr-2026-07-01 D1/D2 hold by construction. Local pattern: the function's own `conductor` branch (validate prospective value, then write); allowed variation: one more accepted path.
- **Identity step in the skill.** Step 1b-ii reads `config read spec_owner`; when empty it asks, defaulting to `gh api user -q .login`, and records via `config set spec_owner`. Unresolved identity is reported with the blocked actions named; auto mode skips the step.
- **Template annotations.** `templates/project-config.yml.template` explains each unasked operator-settable key in place with `Controls:` / `Allowed:` / `Default:` / `Changing it:` comment lines; rendered keys and the anchor do not move.
- **Sequencing.** Engine flag (1-3) → identity tests and fixtures (4-5, 7-8) and template (9-10) fan out; skill tasks (11-16) follow the engine so they name final flag and verb shapes.

## Prerequisites

- Built `conduct-ts` in the worktree (`cd src/conductor && npm run build`) so `ai-conductor config …` resolves during tests that shell out.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Parse `--test-suite-command` into the config-init dispatch
**Story:** 3
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test in `registry-cli.test.ts`: `detectRegistryCommand(['node','cli','config','init','--test-suite-command','pytest -q'])` returns `{ kind: 'config-init', testSuiteCommand: 'pytest -q', hasVerificationFlags: true }`, and the `--test-suite-command=pytest -q` form parses identically.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: add `testSuiteCommand?: string` to the `config-init` dispatch shape and `ConfigInitOptions`; parse both flag forms in the existing flag loop of `detectRegistryCommand` alongside `--test-suite-mode` (pattern: the D8 flags — typed option carried into `runConfigInit`, rediscover via symbols `detectRegistryCommand`, `ConfigInitOptions`, `dispatchRegistry`); thread it through `dispatchRegistry` into `runConfigInit`.
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "config init: parse --test-suite-command into the registry dispatch"

**Done when:**
- `detectRegistryCommand` returns `testSuiteCommand` for both `--test-suite-command <v>` and `--test-suite-command=<v>`, as asserted by the two new dispatch tests.
- `dispatchRegistry` forwards `testSuiteCommand` into `runConfigInit`'s options, as asserted by a spy test on the dispatch path reached from the real argv shape.

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/registry-cli.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/registry-cli.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 2: Reject an empty, multi-line, or unknown config-init flag before any write
**Story:** 1
**Story:** 2
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: `config init --test-suite-command ''` and `--test-suite-command $'a\nb'` exit 1 with stderr naming `--test-suite-command` and the rule (non-empty, single line) and create no `.ai-conductor/config.yml`; `config init --frobnicate x` exits 1 with stderr `unsupported flag --frobnicate` and writes nothing.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: extend `resolveVerificationSelection` to validate `testSuiteCommand` (trim non-empty, no `\n`/`\r`) and return the naming message; make the flag loop in `detectRegistryCommand` collect any other `--` token as `unknownFlags` and have `runConfigInit` refuse on a non-empty list, before `isGitRepo`/`writeProjectConfig`.
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "config init: refuse empty, multi-line, and unknown flags before writing"

**Done when:**
- `runConfigInit` exits 1 naming `--test-suite-command` and writes no config file for the empty and multi-line fixtures, as asserted by the two refusal tests.
- `runConfigInit` exits 1 with `unsupported flag --<name>` and writes no file for an unrecognized `--` flag, as asserted by the unknown-flag test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/registry-cli.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/registry-cli.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 1

### Task 3: Substitute the operator's test command into the rendered test_suite block
**Story:** 3
**Story:** 2
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: `config init --test-suite-mode aggregate --test-suite-drift-budget strict --test-suite-command 'pytest -q'` writes `command: pytest -q` under `test_suite:` and the rendered file contains no `npm test`; a value with shell metacharacters (`make test && echo done`) is written as one YAML scalar and read back unchanged by `loadConfig`; no child process is spawned during init (spy on `execa` shows only the `git rev-parse` call).
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: give `renderVerificationBlock` the selection's `command` (default `npm test` when the flag is absent) and emit it via a YAML-safe scalar (quote when it contains `:`/`#`/leading symbols) at the same `CONFIG_INIT_TEST_SUITE_VERIFICATION` anchor; keep substitution single-anchor, never post-editing the written file.
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "config init: record the operator's aggregate test command"

**Done when:**
- The rendered `test_suite.command` equals the `--test-suite-command` value and `loadConfig` reads it back unchanged, as asserted by the round-trip test.
- A metacharacter-bearing command is stored as a single YAML scalar and `runConfigInit` spawns no process other than `git rev-parse`, as asserted by the literal-storage and no-execution tests.
- With the flag absent the rendered block still contains `command: npm test`, as asserted by the absent-flag test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/conductor/src/engine/registry-cli.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/registry-cli.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 1

### Task 4: Prove flagless and auto-mode config-init output is effectively identical to the pre-change fixture
**Story:** 2
**Story:** 8
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Add a committed fixture `src/conductor/test/fixtures/config-init-defaults.yml` captured from the pre-change `config init --test-suite-mode aggregate --test-suite-drift-budget strict` output and from the flagless byte copy.
2. Restore the fixture to its pre-change bytes (commit `f1130bd37` refreshed it with the annotated output; take the file from the merge base). Write tests asserting, for (a) no flags and (b) the auto-mode invocation the bootstrap skill documents, that `runConfigInit` output parses to settings deep-equal to the parsed fixture and that its non-comment, non-blank lines equal the fixture's non-comment, non-blank lines in order. Flagless `config init` stays a verbatim copy of the template (adr-2026-08-28 D9).
3. Verify GREEN (behavior is preserved; this task proves it). Commit: "config init: pin flagless and auto-mode output to the pre-change fixture"

**Done when:**
- `runConfigInit` with no flags produces a file whose parsed settings deep-equal the parsed pre-change `config-init-defaults.yml` and whose non-comment, non-blank lines equal the fixture's in order, as asserted by the flagless effective-identity test.
- `runConfigInit` with the auto-mode flags produces a file whose parsed settings deep-equal the parsed pre-change fixture and whose non-comment, non-blank lines equal the fixture's in order, as asserted by the auto-mode effective-identity test.
- `config-init-defaults.yml` holds the pre-change bytes captured at the merge base, as asserted by a test comparing it with the merge-base template rendering recorded in the test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/conductor/test/engine/registry-cli.test.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/fixtures/config-init-defaults.yml`

**Verify-only:** yes

**Dependencies:** 3

### Task 5: Prove refuse-to-clobber preserves existing and hand-edited project config under the new flag
**Story:** 6
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write tests: with an existing `.ai-conductor/config.yml` (one fixture as originally rendered, one hand-edited with `command: make check`), `config init --test-suite-command 'pytest'` exits 0, prints `Project config already exists`, and leaves the file byte-identical.
2. Verify GREEN (existing `already-exists` path). Commit: "config init: prove existing and hand-edited configs survive a flagged re-run"

**Done when:**
- `writeProjectConfig` returns `already-exists` and the pre-existing file is byte-identical after a flagged re-run, as asserted by both preservation tests.
- The hand-edited `command: make check` value survives the re-run unchanged, as asserted by the hand-edited fixture test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/conductor/test/engine/registry-cli.test.ts`

**Verify-only:** yes

**Dependencies:** 3

### Task 6: Declare `--test-suite-command` on the commander `config init` command
**Story:** 1
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: `createProgram()` help output for `config init` lists `--test-suite-command <command>` with a description naming it as the aggregate test command.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: add the `.option('--test-suite-command <command>', ...)` declaration next to the existing `config init` command in `cli.ts` (dispatch itself stays in `registry-cli.ts`, matching the existing `--test-suite-mode` declaration shape).
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "cli: list --test-suite-command in config init help"

**Done when:**
- `createProgram().commands` for `config init` includes the `--test-suite-command` option with its description, as asserted by the help-listing test.
- The existing `--test-suite-mode` and `--test-suite-drift-budget` options on `config init` are still listed unchanged, as asserted by the same help-listing test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/conductor/src/cli.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/cli-config-user.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 7: Accept `spec_owner` in `config set` with validation and atomic user-config write
**Story:** 4
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests in `cli-config-user.test.ts`: `userConfigSetCommand({ path: 'spec_owner', value: 'jstoup111' })` writes `spec_owner: jstoup111` to the user config path, preserves unrelated top-level keys, and `config read spec_owner` returns it; an empty or whitespace value exits 1 with a message naming `spec_owner` and writes nothing; `config set other.key x` still exits 1 with `Unsupported user config path`.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: in `userConfigSetCommand`, accept the single path `spec_owner` (no dots) beside the `conductor.*` branch; validate the prospective `{ spec_owner }` through `validateConfig` on the user/merged source plus a non-empty trim check; write via the existing `writeUserConfig` temp-and-rename (pattern: the `conductor` branch's validate-then-write shape in the same function; allowed variation: one additional top-level path, nothing else).
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "config set: accept the spec_owner path (adr-2026-08-09 decision 6)"

**Done when:**
- `userConfigSetCommand` writes `spec_owner` to the user config via `writeUserConfig` and `config read spec_owner` returns the value, as asserted by the round-trip test.
- An empty or whitespace `spec_owner` value is refused with exit 1 naming the key and no file write, as asserted by the empty-value test.
- Every path other than `spec_owner` and `conductor.<key>` still exits 1 with `Unsupported user config path`, as asserted by the unchanged-rejection test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/conductor/src/cli.ts`
- `src/conductor/test/cli-config-user.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 8: Prove identity never reaches project scope and the committed-identity guard is unchanged
**Story:** 4
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write tests: after `config set spec_owner jstoup111`, a project `.ai-conductor/config.yml` in a temp repo is byte-identical to before; `validateConfig` on a project source carrying `spec_owner` still returns the existing `spec_owner must not be set in a project config` error.
2. Verify GREEN (existing guard; `config set` never opens a project path). Commit: "config set: prove spec_owner stays machine-scoped and the project guard holds"

**Done when:**
- `userConfigSetCommand` opens only `userConfigPath()`; the project config file is byte-identical after the write, as asserted by the project-untouched test.
- `validateConfig` on a project source with `spec_owner` returns the existing anti-leak error, as asserted by the guard-unchanged test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/conductor/test/cli-config-user.test.ts`

**Verify-only:** yes

**Dependencies:** 7

### Task 9: Annotate every unasked operator-settable key in the project config template
**Story:** 7
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test in `config-template.test.ts`: for each key in a fixed list of unasked operator-settable keys (`test_suite.working_directory`, `test_suite.timeout_seconds`, `test_suite.inputs`, `test_suite.environment`, `test_suite.scoped_command`, `build_review.rubrics.testQuality.enabled`, `otel.worker_name`, `steps.<name>.model`, `steps.<name>.effort`, `harness_version`), the template contains a comment block naming the key and carrying the four markers `Controls:`, `Allowed:`, `Default:`, `Changing it:`.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: rewrite the template comments so each listed key has that four-line explanation, keeping every rendered (non-comment) key and the `# CONFIG_INIT_TEST_SUITE_VERIFICATION` anchor exactly as they are.
4. Verify GREEN, and re-run Task 4's effective-identity tests (they must still pass, which pins that rendered keys did not move). Commit: "template: explain every unasked project config key in place"

**Done when:**
- Every key in the test's unasked-key list has a template comment block with `Controls:`, `Allowed:`, `Default:`, and `Changing it:`, as asserted by the annotation-coverage test.
- The template still contains the `# CONFIG_INIT_TEST_SUITE_VERIFICATION` anchor and Task 4's effective-identity tests still pass, as asserted by re-running them.

**Files likely touched:**
- `templates/project-config.yml.template`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/config-template.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 4

### Task 10: Prove the template explains no key the harness rejects
**Story:** 7
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: extract every `key:` token named in template comments and assert `validateConfig` accepts a project config built from those keys with their documented defaults (no `unknown key` error).
2. Verify RED if any explained key is unknown; otherwise the test passes on first run and is kept as the drift guard.
3. Implement: fix any comment naming a key `validateConfig` rejects.
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "template: explained keys are all validator-accepted"

**Done when:**
- A project config assembled from every key named in template comments passes `validateConfig` with no unknown-key error, as asserted by the explained-keys-are-known test.
- The rendered (non-comment) keys of the template are unchanged by this task, as asserted by re-running Task 4's effective-identity tests.

**Files likely touched:**
- `templates/project-config.yml.template`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/config-template.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 9

### Task 11: Expand bootstrap Step 1b-i into a per-setting interview with four-element guidance
**Story:** 1
**Story:** 2
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test in a new `bootstrap-skill-config-questions.test.ts` that reads `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` from the harness root: the Step 1b-i section contains one numbered question per key in the decidable-key list (`test_suite.verification.mode`, `test_suite.verification.drift_budget`, `test_suite.command`), each question paragraph contains the four markers `Controls:`, `Allowed:`, `Default:`, `Changing it:`, and each names the `ai-conductor config init` flag that records it.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: rewrite Step 1b-i so it asks every decidable setting one at a time with the four elements; state that a closed-set answer outside the allowed values is re-asked with the values restated and nothing recorded, that a free-text empty or multi-line answer is re-asked, and that the answers are recorded only through the single `ai-conductor config init` invocation with the corresponding flags (never by editing the file).
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "bootstrap: interview every decidable project setting with real guidance"

**Done when:**
- Step 1b-i of `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` has a numbered question for each decidable key carrying `Controls:`, `Allowed:`, `Default:`, and `Changing it:`, as asserted by the question-coverage test.
- Each question names the `config init` flag that records its answer and the section states the closed-set and free-text re-ask rules, as asserted by the recording-and-re-ask test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md`
- `src/conductor/test/bootstrap-skill-config-questions.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 3

### Task 12: Ask for the real test command with an inferred default
**Story:** 3
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: the Step 1b-i test-command question instructs the agent to offer an inferred default derived from project tooling files (`package.json` scripts.test, `pyproject.toml`/`pytest.ini`, `Gemfile`/`Rakefile`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`), and states that with no inference and an empty answer the question is re-asked rather than recording `npm test`.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: add that question text and the inference table to Step 1b-i.
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "bootstrap: ask for the project's test command, infer the default from tooling"

**Done when:**
- The test-command question in `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` names the tooling-file inference table and the empty-and-uninferred re-ask rule, as asserted by the test-command-question test.
- The test-command question records its answer only through the `--test-suite-command` flag on the single `config init` invocation, as asserted by the recording-flag test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md`
- `src/conductor/test/bootstrap-skill-config-questions.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 11

### Task 13: Add the operator-identity step to bootstrap
**Story:** 4
**Story:** 6
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` contains a Step 1b-ii `Operator identity` section that (a) reads the current value with `ai-conductor config read spec_owner`, (b) when empty asks for the identity offering `gh api user -q .login` as the default, (c) records it with `ai-conductor config set spec_owner <login>`, (d) when already set reports the value and does not ask, and (e) re-asks an empty submission with the decline option restated.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: write Step 1b-ii with those five statements, in interactive mode only.
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "bootstrap: establish operator identity through config set"

**Done when:**
- Step 1b-ii reads `spec_owner` via `config read`, records it via `config set spec_owner`, and never instructs a file edit, as asserted by the identity-step test.
- Step 1b-ii reports an already-set identity without asking and re-asks an empty submission with the decline option restated, as asserted by the established-and-empty test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md`
- `src/conductor/test/bootstrap-skill-config-questions.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 7

### Task 14: Report unresolved identity plainly with the blocked actions named
**Story:** 5
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: Step 1b-ii states that when identity stays unresolved (no value, no `gh` login, operator declined) bootstrap prints `Operator identity unresolved` naming `engineer land`, spec handoff, and daemon builds as the actions that will refuse, records no placeholder, and the bootstrap summary marks setup as incomplete rather than successful.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: add that outcome to Step 1b-ii and to the bootstrap completion summary in the same skill.
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "bootstrap: say plainly when identity is unresolved and what stays blocked"

**Done when:**
- Step 1b-ii's unresolved branch names the three blocked actions and forbids a placeholder value, as asserted by the unresolved-report test.
- The bootstrap completion summary reports setup incomplete when identity is unresolved, as asserted by the summary test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md`
- `src/conductor/test/bootstrap-skill-config-questions.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 13

### Task 15: Report already-established settings on a re-run instead of re-asking
**Story:** 6
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: Step 1b-i states that when `.ai-conductor/config.yml` already exists bootstrap reads each decidable key with `ai-conductor config read <key>`, prints `already set: <key> = <value>` for each, asks none of them, and still runs `config init` (which refuses to clobber).
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: add the re-run branch to Step 1b-i.
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "bootstrap: report established settings on re-run, never re-ask"

**Done when:**
- Step 1b-i's re-run branch reads existing keys via `config read`, prints `already set:` lines, and asks no question for them, as asserted by the re-run-branch test.
- The re-run branch still invokes `config init` and relies on its `already-exists` refusal rather than skipping the writer, as asserted by the re-run-writer test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md`
- `src/conductor/test/bootstrap-skill-config-questions.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 11

### Task 16: Keep the auto-mode branch question-free and identity-free
**Story:** 8
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: the auto-mode paragraph of Step 1b-i invokes `ai-conductor config init --test-suite-mode aggregate --test-suite-drift-budget strict` with no `--test-suite-command`, contains no question, and Step 1b-ii states it is skipped entirely in auto mode with no `config set` call.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement: write the auto-mode statements in both steps.
4. Verify GREEN. Commit: "bootstrap: auto mode asks nothing and records no identity"

**Done when:**
- The auto-mode branch of Step 1b-i is the unchanged flagless-defaults invocation with no question text, as asserted by the auto-mode test, and Task 4 pins its output effectively identical.
- Step 1b-ii declares itself skipped in auto mode with no `config set` call, as asserted by the auto-mode identity test.

**Files likely touched:**
- `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md`
- `src/conductor/test/bootstrap-skill-config-questions.test.ts`

## Integration Points

- After Task 3: `ai-conductor config init --test-suite-command 'pytest -q'` produces a project config whose `test_suite.command` the pre-ship gate would invoke; Task 1 owns this CLI-boundary proof through the real argv dispatch.
- After Task 7: `ai-conductor config set spec_owner <login>` followed by `ai-conductor config read spec_owner` round-trips through the user config; Task 7 owns this CLI-boundary proof.
- After Task 16: the bootstrap skill's interactive and auto-mode branches reference only shipped flags and verbs.

## Coverage Check

| Criterion | Task id(s) | Done when quote | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Story 1 happy: Given an operator is present and the project has no configuration yet, when onboarding reaches configuration, then every project-scoped setting the operator is expected to decide is asked, one question at a time, and no such setting is silently defaulted without being asked. | 17 | "asks for the scoped command only when the mode answer is `scoped`" | diff-local |
| Story 1 happy: Given a question is asked, when it is presented, then it states what the setting controls, which values are permitted, which value applies if the operator answers nothing, and what a non-default value changes. | 11 | "carrying `Controls:`, `Allowed:`, `Default:`, and `Changing it:`" | diff-local |
| Story 1 negative: Given a question with a closed set of permitted values, when the operator answers with a value outside that set, then the answer is rejected with the permitted values restated, the same question is asked again, and nothing is recorded for it. | 11, 2 | "states the closed-set and free-text re-ask rules" | diff-local |
| Story 1 negative: Given a question whose answer is free text, when the operator answers with an empty or multi-line value, then the answer is rejected, the question is re-asked, and nothing is recorded for it. | 2, 11 | "exits 1 naming `--test-suite-command` and writes no config file for the empty and multi-line fixtures" | diff-local |
| Story 2 happy: Given the operator answers a question with a permitted non-default value, when onboarding records configuration, then the project configuration carries that value and the harness reads it back as the effective value on its next run. | 3 | "`loadConfig` reads it back unchanged" | diff-local |
| Story 2 happy: Given the operator accepts the offered value at every question, when onboarding records configuration, then the resulting project configuration parses to the same effective settings onboarding produced before this change, except that the aggregate test command is the offered project-specific default Story 3 establishes rather than the former fixed literal, and every line it adds to the pre-change output is a comment or blank line. | 4 | "`runConfigInit` with no flags produces a file whose parsed settings deep-equal the parsed pre-change `config-init-defaults.yml` and whose non-comment, non-blank lines equal the fixture's in order, as asserted by the flagless effective-identity test." | diff-local |
| Story 2 negative: Given a value that would fail configuration validation, when recording is attempted with it, then recording refuses before any file is written, names the rejected value, and the project has no partially written configuration. | 2 | "writes no config file for the empty and multi-line fixtures" | diff-local |
| Story 2 negative: Given recording is invoked with a value for a setting it does not accept, when it runs, then it refuses with a message naming the unsupported setting and writes nothing. | 2 | "exits 1 with `unsupported flag --<name>` and writes no file" | diff-local |
| Story 3 happy: Given an operator is present, when onboarding asks for the project's test command, then the operator's answer is recorded verbatim as the aggregate test command and is the value the pre-ship gate invokes. | 3, 1 | "The rendered `test_suite.command` equals the `--test-suite-command` value" | diff-local |
| Story 3 happy: Given the project's tooling makes a candidate command evident, when the question is asked, then that candidate is offered as the default answer rather than a fixed single-ecosystem literal. | 12 | "names the tooling-file inference table" | diff-local |
| Story 3 negative: Given no candidate can be inferred and the operator answers nothing, when the question resolves, then onboarding re-asks rather than recording a command the project cannot run. | 12 | "the empty-and-uninferred re-ask rule" | diff-local |
| Story 3 negative: Given the operator answers with a command containing shell metacharacters, when it is recorded, then it is stored as a single literal value and is not executed, expanded, or split at recording time. | 3 | "stored as a single YAML scalar and `runConfigInit` spawns no process other than `git rev-parse`" | diff-local |
| Story 4 happy: Given no operator identity is established on this machine, when onboarding runs with an operator present, then it asks for the identity, offering the authenticated hosting-service login as the default when one is available, and records the answer as a machine-scoped setting without the operator editing any file. | 13, 7 | "records it via `config set spec_owner`, and never instructs a file edit" | diff-local |
| Story 4 happy: Given operator identity is already established on this machine, when onboarding runs, then it reports the established identity and does not ask again. | 13 | "reports an already-set identity without asking" | diff-local |
| Story 4 negative: Given the operator submits an empty value to the identity question rather than explicitly declining it, when the answer is processed, then it is rejected, the question is re-asked with the decline option restated, and no identity is recorded. | 7, 13 | "An empty or whitespace `spec_owner` value is refused with exit 1 naming the key and no file write" | diff-local |
| Story 4 negative: Given onboarding records operator identity, when the project's committed configuration is inspected afterwards, then it contains no operator identity, and a committed configuration that does carry one is still rejected at load exactly as before. | 8 | "`validateConfig` on a project source with `spec_owner` returns the existing anti-leak error" | diff-local |
| Story 5 happy: Given no identity is established, no authenticated login is available, and the operator declines to supply one, when onboarding finishes configuration, then it states that operator identity is unresolved and names the actions that will refuse until it is established. | 14 | "names the three blocked actions and forbids a placeholder value" | diff-local |
| Story 5 negative: Given identity is unresolved at the end of onboarding, when onboarding completes, then it does not report a fully successful setup and does not invent or record a placeholder identity. | 14 | "reports setup incomplete when identity is unresolved" | diff-local |
| Story 6 happy: Given a project whose configuration already exists, when onboarding runs again, then every previously set value is preserved byte-for-byte and the operator is told which settings are already established rather than being asked to decide them again. | 15 | "prints `already set:` lines, and asks no question for them" | diff-local |
| Story 6 happy: Given operator identity is already established, when onboarding runs again, then it is reported and preserved. | 13 | "reports an already-set identity without asking" | diff-local |
| Story 6 negative: Given a project whose configuration already exists, when the recording step is invoked again with different answers, then it refuses to overwrite, reports that the configuration already exists, and the file is unchanged. | 5 | "the pre-existing file is byte-identical after a flagged re-run" | diff-local |
| Story 6 negative: Given a project configuration that has been hand-edited since it was recorded, when onboarding runs again, then the hand-edited values are preserved and reported, not replaced with defaults. | 5 | "The hand-edited `command: make check` value survives the re-run unchanged" | diff-local |
| Story 7 happy: Given onboarding has recorded a project configuration, when the operator opens it, then every top-level setting the walkthrough did not ask about is accompanied by an authored explanation stating what it controls, its permitted values, its default, and the consequence of changing it, and every nested setting either has its own such explanation or sits under a section explanation that links to the full configuration reference and says the ai-conductor agent can set the value on request. | 18 | "Every top-level project-settable key derived from `CONFIG_CONSUMER_KEY_SETS` (excluding the user-scoped `conductor` set, `spec_owner`, and the three asked keys) has an authored template comment block whose `Controls:`, `Allowed:`, `Default:`, and `Changing it:` lines name concrete permitted values, the concrete default, and a consequence, the seven key-specific blocks that commit `782b010cf` replaced are restored, and no block contains the placeholder phrases `a value accepted by the configuration validator`, `use the harness default`, or `changes this setting for the project`, as asserted by the authored-explanation test." | diff-local |
| Story 7 negative: Given the recorded configuration, when its explanations are compared with the keys the harness accepts, then no explained key is unknown to the harness, no top-level decidable-but-unasked key lacks an authored explanation, no nested key lacks both its own explanation and a section reference line, and no explanation is generic placeholder text. | 18 | "Every `Controls:` token in the template names a key in the derived dotted-path set, and every derived nested key either has its own block or its top-level section block carries a `Reference:` line containing `https://jstoup111.github.io/ai-conductor/reference/configuration` and stating that the ai-conductor agent can set the value on request, as asserted by the coverage test, so a block naming a rejected key, or an accepted key with neither a block nor a section reference, fails." | diff-local |
| Story 8 happy: Given onboarding runs with no operator present, when it reaches configuration, then it asks no question, records today's defaults, and completes. | 16 | "the unchanged flagless-defaults invocation with no question text" | diff-local |
| Story 8 negative: Given onboarding runs with no operator present and no identity is established, when it reaches the identity step, then it neither asks nor records an identity, and the existing fail-closed behavior on later identity-dependent actions is unchanged. | 16 | "declares itself skipped in auto mode with no `config set` call" | diff-local |
| Story 8 negative: Given onboarding runs with no operator present, when its output is compared with the pre-change unattended output, then the recorded project configuration parses to the same effective settings and differs only by added comment or blank lines. | 4 | "`runConfigInit` with the auto-mode flags produces a file whose parsed settings deep-equal the parsed pre-change fixture and whose non-comment, non-blank lines equal the fixture's in order, as asserted by the auto-mode effective-identity test." | diff-local |

> **Amended 2026-09-17 by operator (prd_audit PLAN_GAP resolution for S1.1, S7.1, S7.2):** The operator chose to ask for the scoped test command instead of dropping `scoped` from the walkthrough, and to explain every project-settable top-level key instead of narrowing Story 7 to a fixed list. Task 17 owns the S1.1 gap (answering `scoped` silently recorded a fixed `scoped_command` literal). Task 18 owns the S7.1/S7.2 gaps (nine explained keys against 46 accepted; the coverage test hardcoded the nine). Tasks 9, 10, and 11 keep their delivered scope; the Coverage Check rows for those criteria now cite Tasks 17 and 18.

### Task 17: Ask for the scoped test command and record it through a config-init flag
**Story:** 1
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: in `src/conductor/test/engine/registry-cli.test.ts`, `config init --test-suite-mode scoped --test-suite-scoped-command "npm test -- {selectors}"` renders `scoped_command: npm test -- {selectors}` through `yamlScalar`; `--test-suite-mode scoped` without the scoped flag returns a naming message and writes no file; `--test-suite-scoped-command` with `--test-suite-mode aggregate` returns a naming message and writes no file; an empty or multi-line scoped command is refused before any write. In `src/conductor/test/bootstrap-skill-config-questions.test.ts`, extend the decidable-key list with `test_suite.scoped_command` as a conditional question that carries the four elements and names `--test-suite-scoped-command`.
2. Verify RED.
3. Implement in `src/conductor/src/engine/registry-cli.ts`: parse `--test-suite-scoped-command` (bare and `=` forms) into the config-init dispatch; validate it with the same non-empty single-line rule as `--test-suite-command`; make `renderVerificationBlock` substitute the operator's value instead of the fixed literal and never render a `scoped_command` line when the mode is `aggregate`. Declare the flag on the commander `config init` command next to `--test-suite-command`.
4. Implement in `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` Step 1b-i: add a question for `test_suite.scoped_command` asked only when question 1 was answered `scoped` — Controls: the command the scoped verification mode runs for selected tests, with `{selectors}` substituted; Allowed: one non-empty single-line command containing `{selectors}`; Default: none, the answer is required once `scoped` is chosen; Changing it: records the project's selected-test runner. Record with `--test-suite-scoped-command <command>`. Auto mode never reaches this question because it records `aggregate`.
5. Verify GREEN and re-run Task 4's effective-identity tests. Commit: "bootstrap: ask for the scoped test command instead of defaulting it"

**Done when:**
- `config init` renders `scoped_command` only from `--test-suite-scoped-command`, refuses the flag without `--test-suite-mode scoped`, refuses `scoped` mode without the flag, and refuses an empty or multi-line value before any write, as asserted by the registry-cli tests.
- Step 1b-i of `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` asks for the scoped command only when the mode answer is `scoped`, with the four elements and the recording flag named, as asserted by the question-coverage test.
- Task 4's flagless and auto-mode effective-identity tests still pass.

- `src/conductor/src/engine/registry-cli.ts`
- `src/conductor/src/cli.ts`
- `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/registry-cli.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 11, 12

### Task 18: Explain every project-settable key at every depth and derive the coverage check from the validator
**Story:** 7
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests in `src/conductor/test/engine/config-template.test.ts`: derive the expected dotted-path key set from every entry of `CONFIG_CONSUMER_KEY_SETS` in `src/conductor/src/engine/config.ts` (top-level keys plus each nested set under its config path, e.g. `defaults.model`, `steps.by_tier.effort`, `harness_self_host.build_auth.mode`) minus the user-scoped `conductor` set, the user-scoped keys `conductor` and `spec_owner`, and minus the three keys the walkthrough asks (`test_suite.verification.mode`, `test_suite.verification.drift_budget`, `test_suite.command`; `test_suite` itself stays in the set because its unasked sub-keys need explanation); assert every derived key has a `Controls: <key>` comment block with `Allowed:`, `Default:`, and `Changing it:` in `templates/project-config.yml.template`; assert the set of `Controls: <key>` tokens in the template equals the derived dotted-path set exactly; keep a `validateConfig` check assembled from the top-level tokens and their stated defaults that passes with no unknown-key error.
2. Verify RED (missing `test_suite.environment`, `defaults.model`, and the other unexplained keys).
3. Implement (amended 2026-09-18 by operator, prd_audit S7.1 PLAN_GAP: narrow the explained set): hand-author a real four-line block for every top-level derived key and for the nested keys an operator commonly sets, restore the seven key-specific blocks commit `782b010cf` replaced, delete every generic placeholder block, and give each top-level section block a `Reference:` line linking `https://jstoup111.github.io/ai-conductor/reference/configuration` and saying the ai-conductor agent can set the value on request; superseding the original instruction to annotate every derived key in `templates/project-config.yml.template` with the four-line block, keeping every rendered (non-comment) key and the `# CONFIG_INIT_TEST_SUITE_VERIFICATION` anchor exactly as they are; a nested key without its own block is covered only by its section's `Reference:` line, never by placeholder text.
4. Verify GREEN and re-run Task 4's effective-identity tests. Commit: "template: explain every project-settable key, derived from the validator"

**Done when:**
- Every top-level project-settable key derived from `CONFIG_CONSUMER_KEY_SETS` (excluding the user-scoped `conductor` set, `spec_owner`, and the three asked keys) has an authored template comment block whose `Controls:`, `Allowed:`, `Default:`, and `Changing it:` lines name concrete permitted values, the concrete default, and a consequence, the seven key-specific blocks that commit `782b010cf` replaced are restored, and no block contains the placeholder phrases `a value accepted by the configuration validator`, `use the harness default`, or `changes this setting for the project`, as asserted by the authored-explanation test.
- Every `Controls:` token in the template names a key in the derived dotted-path set, and every derived nested key either has its own block or its top-level section block carries a `Reference:` line containing `https://jstoup111.github.io/ai-conductor/reference/configuration` and stating that the ai-conductor agent can set the value on request, as asserted by the coverage test, so a block naming a rejected key, or an accepted key with neither a block nor a section reference, fails.
- The template still contains the `# CONFIG_INIT_TEST_SUITE_VERIFICATION` anchor and Task 4's effective-identity tests still pass.

**Files likely touched:**
- `templates/project-config.yml.template`
- `src/conductor/test/engine/config-template.test.ts`

**Dependencies:** 9, 10

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab1-1: Reshape the D9 amendment of adr-2026-08-28-test-suite-drift-budget-and-verification-mode into additive form: restore the merge-base sentence asserting flagless and auto-mode config-init output is byte-identical verbatim, add the operator's 2026-09-18 effective-settings qualification beside it as a dated amendment item numbered D<n> under the Decision heading so it is citable by the land gate, leave every other approved decision untouched, and obtain the operator reseal for that decisions path in the same change
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** AB-1 is a defect in the form of an approved-ADR amendment, not implementation drift, and its repair edits a sealed artifact under the decisions directory, which this skill forbids routing to build or acceptance_specs (confidence 97%, verified from the seal record and the review). The seal's third rebaseline records the operator's 2026-09-18 approval to amend D9 of adr-2026-08-28-test-suite-drift-budget-and-verification-mode, so the substance is decided; what is wrong is that the merge-base sentence asserting byte-identical flagless and auto-mode output was deleted rather than preserved beside the new effective-settings qualification, which the governing architecture review at architecture-review-2026-09-14-bootstrap-register-never-walk-the-user-through-use lines 117-118 requires to be additive. architecture_review owns ADR authoring and the operator reseal gate for that path, so it is the only step that can both reshape the text into additive form and obtain the reseal; a build step editing that path would halt on protected-artifact self-amendment. No coverage or decision is removed: the task restores previously approved text and keeps the operator-approved qualification beside it, and memory of this repo's land gate requires the added note to carry a numbered D<n> so it stays citable. Found and deliberately excluded: no sibling ADR was amended by this feature — the seal shows exactly one decisions-directory rebaseline — so there is no second non-additive rewrite to sweep.
**Governing clause:** adr-2026-08-28-test-suite-drift-budget-and-verification-mode D9
**Done when:**
- adr-2026-08-28-test-suite-drift-budget-and-verification-mode D9 is satisfied by this task.
- Re-run as-built and confirm task rem-as-built-rem-ab1-1 is complete.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab2-1: Decide and record, as a new ADR governing the daemon-session guard exemption boundary in src/conductor/src/execution/daemon-session.ts:45-77, whether the engine-managed bootstrap prelude may invoke the project-config writer at all — weighing D8's requirement that bootstrap record answers through config init against the allowlist contract that forbids state-mutating verbs, and naming which of a step-scoped exemption, an engine-performed write, or an explicit out-of-scope declaration governs; state the production root-to-command chain the decision makes reachable
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** AB-2 cannot be closed without changing or clarifying an approved harness-wide boundary, which is what this disposition is for (confidence 96%, verified from current source). I confirmed the chain myself: the managed prelude dispatches bootstrap through src/conductor/src/engine/project-prelude.ts:122-128 and 171-189, the provider adapters stamp CONDUCT_DAEMON_SESSION=1, src/conductor/src/index.ts:615-625 runs guardDaemonSessionInvocation before any subcommand parsing, and the allowlist at src/conductor/src/execution/daemon-session.ts:54-77 omits config, so the skill's config init call is refused. The constraints conflict: D8 requires bootstrap to record answers through config init, while the allowlist's own documented contract at daemon-session.ts:45-53 states each entry is a deliberate exemption and explicitly forbids adding state-mutating verbs — and config init writes a project file. Load-bearing correction to the review's framing, verified at 99%: this unreachability is NOT introduced by this feature. The merge-base skill at e7e899d56:skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md:82,88 already invoked ai-conductor config init, so the managed-prelude path was equally unreachable before this branch; the feature added questions to a call site that was already blocked. No plan task, story, or ADR of this feature names daemon-session.ts, and no ADR governs the guard at all (no decisions-directory file mentions it), so choosing between a scoped per-step exemption, an engine-performed write, and declaring the managed-prelude path out of scope is an architecture decision this step must not make. This is not architectural-clarity halt material because architecture_review is the step that owns exactly this decision and can record it autonomously. No code, test, or assertion is removed by the emitted task — it authors a decision record only. Found and deliberately excluded: the guard also blocks every other non-allowlisted verb the skill might grow later, but sweeping the whole allowlist contract is the decision being routed, not a separate site.
**Governing clause:** adr-2026-08-28-test-suite-drift-budget-and-verification-mode D8
**Done when:**
- adr-2026-08-28-test-suite-drift-budget-and-verification-mode D8 is satisfied by this task.
- Re-run as-built and confirm task rem-as-built-rem-ab2-1 is complete.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab3-1: In the same daemon-session guard decision, state explicitly whether a read-only config verb (config read spec_owner) is exempt on different grounds from a user-config writer (config set spec_owner), and record which of the two the bootstrap identity step may invoke from the engine-managed prelude, naming the guard call site src/conductor/src/execution/daemon-session.ts:54-77 and the identity writer src/conductor/src/cli.ts:326-343
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** AB-3 is the operator-identity limb of the identical guard boundary and shares AB-2's root cause and evidence (confidence 96%, verified from current source): src/conductor/src/execution/daemon-session.ts:54-77 omits config, so both config read spec_owner and config set spec_owner required at skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md:115-119 are refused at daemon-session.ts:97-110 before dispatch. It is routed to the same step rather than to build because the remedy is the same unmade boundary decision, and because these two verbs differ in kind — config read mutates nothing while config set spec_owner writes machine-scoped user config — so whether a read-only config verb is exempt on different grounds than a writer is part of the decision and not derivable from the evidence. The task below is scoped to that distinction only and does not duplicate AB-2's task. No existing code, test, or assertion is relaxed by it. Found and deliberately excluded: the direct human shell path for these verbs is already reachable and correct per the review's Production Reachability section, so nothing in cli.ts:316-349 is touched.
**Parent task:** 13
**Governing clause:** Task 13
**Done when:**
- Task 13 is satisfied by this task.
- Re-run as-built and confirm task rem-as-built-rem-ab3-1 is complete.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab4-1: In the same daemon-session guard decision, rule on the re-run inspection path — the per-key config read calls and the refuse-to-clobber config init at skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md:69-72 — and record explicitly whether declaring the engine-managed bootstrap prelude an unsupported path is the chosen resolution, noting that the merge-base skill at e7e899d56 already invoked config init so the unreachability predates this feature and is not a regression introduced by it
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** AB-4 is the re-run-inspection limb of the same guard boundary (confidence 96%, verified from current source): the per-key config read calls and the no-clobber config init invocation that skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md:69-72 mandates on re-run are refused by the same allowlist omission at src/conductor/src/execution/daemon-session.ts:54-77. Routed to architecture_review with AB-2 and AB-3 because one decision closes all three and splitting them across steps would produce three partial repairs of one boundary. The task below carries the scope question the other two do not: because the merge-base skill already invoked config init (e7e899d56:skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md:82,88), declaring the engine-managed prelude an unsupported bootstrap path is a legitimate resolution that closes AB-2 through AB-4 without widening a security guard, and the decision must say so or rule it out rather than leave it implicit. It removes no code, test, or assertion. Found and deliberately excluded: the two UNEXERCISED signatures the review lists (established-value reporting and unresolved-identity reporting) are consequences of this same unreachability, not independent findings, and are covered by whichever resolution this decision selects.
**Parent task:** 15
**Governing clause:** Task 15
**Done when:**
- Task 15 is satisfied by this task.
- Re-run as-built and confirm task rem-as-built-rem-ab4-1 is complete.
