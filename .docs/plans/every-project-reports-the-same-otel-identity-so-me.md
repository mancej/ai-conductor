# Implementation Plan: OTel two-layer identity

**Date:** 2026-08-26
**Stories:** .docs/stories/every-project-reports-the-same-otel-identity-so-me.md
**Conflict check:** Clean as of 2026-08-26

## Summary

Makes per-project and per-run metric identity exportable without collector rewriting: identity
attributes injected on every metric data point plus `service.instance.id` on the Resource, in
6 tasks.

## Technical Approach

Per the amended adr-014 (2026-08-26): `service.name` stays constant; the resolved run id is
additionally exported as `service.instance.id`; `project` (basename of the project root) and
`feature` become data-point attributes on every instrument, injected at exactly one seam so
instruments added concurrently (#1941's cost/dispatch counters) inherit them automatically.

- `MetricsRecorder` gains a constructor parameter `identityAttrs: { project: string; feature: string }`
  and one private helper that merges it into a per-point attribute object; every
  `record()`/`add()` call site passes through that helper. No call site constructs its attribute
  object inline after this change — that is what makes the seam single.
- `buildResource` (`src/conductor/src/engine/otel/resource.ts`) becomes signal-scoped. Both scopes
  carry `service.instance.id`, composed from the resolved project name and the feature (`unknown`
  for either missing half); the trace scope additionally carries `conductor.run.id` and
  `conductor.engine.version`. The run id is on neither the instance nor any metric resource
  attribute: backends translate `service.instance.id` into a per-series `instance` label and fold
  the whole resource attribute set into `target_info`'s label set, so any run-varying value on the
  metric side mints series per run. The run-id resolution chain and the never-throws contract are
  untouched, and `conductor.run.id` remains the run's carrier on traces.
- `OtelVisualizer` computes `identityAttrs` from its context — `project: basename(ctx.project)`
  (node:path) and `feature: ctx.feature` — and passes it to `MetricsRecorder`. `ctx.project`
  continues to receive the project root from the single production construction site
  (`createOtelVisualizer` in `src/conductor/src/index.ts`), which is unchanged.
- Test pattern: extend the existing harness in `src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics.test.ts`
  (`makeVisualizer` + `InMemoryMetricExporter` lookup, T15/T16 style) and
  `src/conductor/test/engine/otel/resource.test.ts` (direct `buildResource` assertions). Follow
  those files' existing describe/it shape; allowed variation: direct `MetricsRecorder`
  construction with a test `Meter` where the visualizer path cannot express a case.

Amended 2026-08-27 (adr-014 amendment, configurable project name): the data-point `project` value
is `otel.project_name` when that config key is present and non-blank (trimmed), and
`basename(ctx.project)` otherwise. The override rides the existing `otel:` block through
`ResolvedOtelConfig` into `OtelVisualizer`, which already receives that resolved config as its
first constructor argument — no new construction site, no second resolution path, and the
basename derivation stays exactly where Task 5 puts it as the fallback branch. Task 6 delivers it.

Rebase note: #1941 (merged spec, in-flight) adds two counters to `metrics.ts`. If it lands first,
route its counters' attributes through the same merge helper during rebase; the identity seam is
designed so this is mechanical.

## Prerequisites

None — all touched modules exist on main; no new dependencies.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Signal-scoped Resources — feature-stable for metrics, run-identified for traces
**Story:** Story 2
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests in the existing resource test file: the metric Resource carries `service.name`, `service.instance.id` (project and feature joined by a slash), `conductor.project`, `conductor.feature`, `conductor.branch` and nothing else; the span Resource carries those plus `conductor.run.id` and `conductor.engine.version`; both carry the same `service.instance.id`; a configured project name is used as the project half; an absent project or feature yields `unknown` in that half.
2. Verify tests fail (RED).
3. Implement: give `buildResource` a signal scope so it returns the feature-stable attribute set for metrics and that set plus the run-varying attributes for traces, and have `OtelVisualizer.initializeProviders` install the metric Resource on the `MeterProvider` and the trace Resource on the `BasicTracerProvider`.
4. Verify tests pass (GREEN), including all pre-existing resource tests unmodified.
5. Commit: "Scope the OTel Resource by signal so metrics stay feature-stable".

**Done when:**
- The metric Resource assertion passes and names the exact attribute set, so an added run-varying attribute fails it.
- A passing assertion pins `conductor.run.id` and `conductor.engine.version` present on the span Resource and absent from the metric Resource.
- A passing assertion pins `service.name === 'ai-conductor'` and identical `service.instance.id` on both Resources.
- All pre-existing resource tests pass unmodified.

**Files:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/resource.ts — signal-scoped attribute sets + service.instance.id composition
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts — install the metric Resource on the meter provider and the trace Resource on the tracer provider
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/resource.test.ts — signal-scope and instance-id tests

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 2: Resource robustness and stability negatives
**Story:** Story 2
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing (or pinning) tests: two builds differing only in engine version yield byte-identical metric Resource attribute sets; with an unwritable pipeline directory both Resources still build and no exception reaches the caller; a whitespace-only session file still yields a minted `conductor.run.id` on the span Resource while the metric Resource is unaffected.
2. Verify RED/pinning status honestly (the existing never-throws implementation may already satisfy a case — keep it as pinning coverage).
3. Implement any gap.
4. Verify tests pass (GREEN).
5. Commit: "Pin metric-Resource stability and never-throws semantics".

**Done when:**
- The differing-engine-version test passes with identical metric Resource attribute sets.
- The unwritable-directory test passes with no throw and a composed non-empty `service.instance.id`.
- The whitespace-file test passes with a minted span-side `conductor.run.id` and an unchanged metric Resource.

**Files:** same

**Dependencies:** Task 1

### Task 3: Identity attributes injected at one seam in MetricsRecorder
**Story:** Story 1
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests in the metrics test file (makeVisualizer harness): after a step_completed close with tokens and a pipeline_closeout event, every exported data point of `conductor.step.duration`, `conductor.step.retries`, `conductor.step.tokens`, and `conductor.pipeline.closeout.duration` carries `project` and `feature` attributes with the injected values, alongside its pre-existing attributes unchanged; two recorder instances with different identity values produce data points with distinct `project` values.
2. Verify tests fail (RED).
3. Implement: add the `identityAttrs` constructor parameter and a private `withIdentity(attrs)` merge helper in `MetricsRecorder`; convert every `record()`/`add()` call site to pass through it. The seam is single: after this change no call site in the class constructs its final attribute object without the helper (diff property).
4. Verify tests pass (GREEN); pre-existing T15/T16 tests updated only where they assert exact attribute sets, with their original keys/values still asserted.
5. Commit: "Inject project/feature identity attributes on every metric data point".

**Done when:**
- Identity-attribute assertions pass for all four existing instruments via the in-memory exporter.
- The two-instance test asserts distinct `project` values.
- The diff shows every `record()`/`add()` call in the recorder routing its attributes through the single merge helper.
- All pre-existing attribute keys and values still assert successfully (additive-only).

**Files:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts — identityAttrs param + merge helper
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics.test.ts — identity attribute tests

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 4: Run id stays off data points; totals remain aggregable
**Story:** Story 1
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing (or pinning) tests: for every exported data point across all instruments in a full-run fixture, no attribute value equals the run id and no attribute key names a run id; summing a counter's data points across two recorder instances with different `project` values yields the arithmetic total (instrument names identical across instances — identity never forks the instrument name).
2. Verify RED/pinning status honestly.
3. Implement any gap (the merge helper must not receive the run id; nothing prefixes instrument names with identity).
4. Verify tests pass (GREEN).
5. Commit: "Pin run id off data points and instrument-name stability".

**Done when:**
- The no-run-id assertion passes over every data point in the fixture.
- The cross-instance sum test passes with identical instrument names.

**Files:** same as Task 3

**Dependencies:** Task 3

### Task 5: Visualizer derives and wires identity end-to-end
**Story:** Story 3
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: driving `createOtelVisualizer` with in-memory exporters, a project path of nested directories, and a feature name yields data points whose `project` equals the path's basename (not the absolute path) and whose `feature` equals the given name; the exported spans and metrics carry the same `service.instance.id` on their resources (one resource, both providers); with feature `unknown`, the data point carries `feature` = `unknown` verbatim.
2. Verify tests fail (RED).
3. Implement: in the `OtelVisualizer` constructor, compute `identityAttrs` as basename of `ctx.project` plus `ctx.feature`, and pass it to `MetricsRecorder`.
4. Verify tests pass (GREEN).
5. Commit: "Derive basename project identity in OtelVisualizer wiring".

**Done when:**
- The end-to-end basename and feature assertions pass through the production construction path.
- The `unknown` passthrough test passes.
- Story 1's basename criterion is covered by this task's end-to-end assertion (coverage note for the mapping).

**Files:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts — identityAttrs derivation + wiring
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.test.ts — end-to-end identity tests

**Dependencies:** Task 3

### Task 6: Configurable project name overrides the basename
**Story:** Story 1
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests: `resolveOtelConfig` carries a trimmed `otel.project_name` onto both enabled `ResolvedOtelConfig` variants and omits it when the key is absent, blank, or whitespace-only; driving `createOtelVisualizer` with a configured name yields data points whose `project` equals that name rather than the root's basename; two roots sharing a basename with distinct configured names yield distinct `project` values; absent/blank/whitespace-only configured names fall back to the basename with no error; with an override set, `service.name` is still `ai-conductor` and the Resource `conductor.project` is still the absolute root.
2. Verify tests fail (RED).
3. Implement: add optional `project_name?: string` to `OtelConfig`; resolve and trim it onto the enabled `ResolvedOtelConfig` variants in `resolveOtelConfig`; in the `OtelVisualizer` constructor use the resolved name when non-empty and `basename(ctx.project)` otherwise.
4. Document the key in `docs/reference/configuration.md` alongside the other `otel:` keys, stating the basename default.
5. Verify tests pass (GREEN), including every pre-existing otel-config, metrics, resource, and visualizer test unmodified.
6. Commit: "Let otel.project_name override the basename project identity".

**Done when:**
- The configured-name assertion passes through the production construction path.
- The same-basename/distinct-configured-name test yields distinct `project` values.
- Absent, blank, and whitespace-only configured names each fall back to the basename with no error raised.
- With an override set, `service.name` and the Resource `conductor.project` assertions are unchanged.
- `docs/reference/configuration.md` documents `otel.project_name` and its basename default.

**Files:**
- src/conductor/src/types/config.ts — optional `project_name` on `OtelConfig`
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-config.ts — resolve/trim onto `ResolvedOtelConfig`
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts — override-else-basename branch
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/otel-config.test.ts — resolution and blank-fallback tests
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.test.ts — end-to-end override tests
- docs/reference/configuration.md — `otel.project_name` reference row

**Dependencies:** Task 5

## Task Dependency Graph

```
Task 1 ─▶ Task 2
Task 3 ─▶ Task 4
Task 3 ─▶ Task 5 ─▶ Task 6
```

## Integration Points

- After Task 6: the exported `project` dimension is operator-controllable, so two roots sharing a
  directory name are distinguishable from harness exports alone.
- After Task 5: full identity observable end-to-end — the per-feature resource instance id
  (Task 1) + data-point identity (Task 3) through the real construction path, with the run id
  reachable only through `conductor.run.id` on the trace Resource.

## Verification

- [ ] All Story 1-3 happy-path criteria covered (Tasks 1, 3, 5, 6)
- [ ] All negative-path criteria covered as explicit tasks (Tasks 2, 4, 6) plus Story 3's passthrough negative in Task 5
- [ ] No task exceeds 5 minutes
- [ ] Every task has falsifiable Done-when checks
- [ ] Dependencies explicit and acyclic

### Task rem-prd-audit-rem-fr-s31-1: src/conductor/test/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.test.ts:277,296 — rebuild the Task 5 identity fixture to construct via `createOtelVisualizer(resolved, ctx)` (src/conductor/src/engine/otel/create-otel-visualizer.ts:19-29) instead of `new OtelVisualizer(...)`, and pass a real VisualizerStartContext to `start(identityEmitter, ctx)` so the deprecated legacyStartContext fallback at otel-visualizer.ts:282 is not exercised. Keep every existing identity assertion in that block byte-for-byte (basename derivation :313, distinct roots :337, feature fallback :327) — this changes only the construction path, never what is asserted.
**Gate:** prd-audit
**Rationale:** Evidence gap, not a defect (audit confidence 90%, verified): src/conductor/test/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.test.ts:277 builds the identity fixture with `new OtelVisualizer(resolved, {...})` and :296 calls `vis.start(identityEmitter)` with no VisualizerStartContext, so the assertions run through the `legacyStartContext` fallback at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts:282 whose backing fields are marked @deprecated for identity (:130-136), while production constructs through createOtelVisualizer at src/conductor/src/engine/plugin-loader.ts:244. Plan Task 5 (.docs/plans/every-project-reports-the-same-otel-identity-so-me.md:142) already owns this — its step 1 specifies driving `createOtelVisualizer` and its Done-when requires the assertions to pass through the production construction path — so the repair is inside an existing task's contract, not a planning omission. This strengthens an existing test rather than removing coverage: every current identity assertion is preserved and merely re-driven through the production entry point, so Task 5's delivered coverage survives intact. Class sweep: the same legacy-construction shape is the only identity driver in this file; the other createOtelVisualizer drivers at src/conductor/test/daemon-otel-wiring.test.ts:321,364 assert renderer errors and teardown and carry no identity assertions to restate, so they are named found-and-excluded rather than edited.
**Criterion:** S3.1
**Parent task:** 5
**Done when:**
- S3.1 is satisfied by this task.
