# Implementation Plan: Export the dispatch dimensions the engine already holds

> **Amended 2026-09-10 by operator:** Resolve as-built findings AB-1–AB-4 in
> BUILD. Carry `preferredProvider`, resolved effort, and tier on production
> `provider_attempt` events; retain the latest complete dispatch dimensions for
> failed duration/span closure; preserve the first applicable fallback reason
> across the candidate chain until successful fallback closure. Keep ADR-014's
> single `MetricsListener` architecture by removing the duplicate/dead
> `OtelVisualizer` metric implementation introduced by Tasks 9–10 while keeping
> its span enrichment. Existing tests should assert these production paths, not
> a metrics-enabled visualizer path.

## Summary

Thread reasoning effort and complexity tier onto the step close events, make `provider_attempt` a real metrics projection, and put model, effort, provider, tier, and fallback on the step duration/retry/dispatch series and the step span — with `fallbackReason` and `TokenUsage` detail on the span only, per adr-014 D10–D11. Ten tasks.

## Technical Approach

- **One dimension shape, both projections.** A `DispatchDimensions` value (`{ model?, effort?, provider?, tier?, fallback? }`) is built once from an event and passed to `MetricsRecorder.onStepClose`, `onRetry`, and `onDispatch`. The recorder merges only defined members into the data-point attributes (the `feature_cost_snapshot` handling of optional `model`/`source` is the local pattern: copy the "only add the key when the value is defined" trait; do not add `unknown` fallbacks). Both the daemon `MetricsListener` and the interactive `OtelVisualizer` build that value the same way, which is what condition C1 demands.
- **Effort and tier travel on the event.** `ProviderExecutionResult.resolvedEffort` already exists; it is surfaced onto `StepRunResult.effort` at the same spread where `resolvedModel` becomes `model` in `step-runners.ts`, and emitted on `step_completed`/`step_failed` beside `model` in `conductor.ts`. `tier` is read from `state.complexity_tier` at the same emit site. Keys are omitted when undefined.
- **Provider comes through the existing tracker.** `DispatchMeteringTracker.observe` already selects each invoked dispatch once and drops lifecycle rows; `provider_attempt` gains optional `preferredProvider`, and the observation carries it with `fallbackReason`, so `fallback` (= preferred known and ≠ actual) is computable when the dispatch occurs. The daemon listener gets its own tracker instance per feature so the no-op `provider_attempt` handler can call `recorder.onDispatch` exactly as the interactive switch does.
- **Retry dimensions travel on the retry event.** `step_retry` gains optional `model`, `effort`, `provider`, and `tier`, populated from the failed attempt's `StepRunResult` and current run state before the next attempt starts. Both metrics consumers project retries directly from that occurrence; they do not cache later close-event data or buffer retry metrics. The existing `escalatedModel` and `escalatedEffort` remain the separate description of the upcoming attempt.
- **Spans.** `SpanManager` stores the latest `provider_attempt` observation per open step and sets the D10 attributes at close: `conductor.model`, `conductor.effort`, `conductor.provider`, `conductor.provider.preferred`, `conductor.fallback`, `conductor.fallback.reason`, `conductor.complexity_tier`, `conductor.usage.reasoning_output`, `conductor.usage.turns`, `conductor.usage.duration_ms`, `conductor.cost.source`. Numeric members are set only when finite.
- **Sequencing.** Event fields first (Task 1–2), recorder attribute seam (Task 3), then the three metric behaviors (4–6), spans (7–8), parity (9), and the interactive wiring (10).

## Prerequisites

- adr-014 amendment D10–D11 (2026-09-09) is on the spec branch.
- `DispatchMeteringTracker` (`src/conductor/src/engine/dispatch-metering.ts`) and `MetricsListener.METRICS_HANDLERS` exist on main as described in the architecture review.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Surface resolved effort on the step run result
**Story:** 1
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: in the step-runner test that already asserts `model` is set on the returned result from `resolvedModel`, assert `effort` equals the provider result's `resolvedEffort` and is absent when `resolvedEffort` is undefined
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: add `effort?: EffortLevel` to `StepRunResult`; in the runner spread that maps `result.resolvedModel` → `model`, add the same conditional spread for `result.resolvedEffort` → `effort`
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Surface resolved effort on StepRunResult"

**Done when:**
- `StepRunResult` declares optional `effort` typed as `EffortLevel`, and the runner's result spread copies `resolvedEffort` into it only when defined
- A step-runner unit test asserts `effort: 'high'` on the result for a provider result with `resolvedEffort: 'high'` and asserts the `effort` key is absent for one without

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — `StepRunResult.effort`
- src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts — result spread
- src/conductor/test/engine/step-runners.test.ts — assertions

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 2: Emit effort and tier on step_completed and step_failed
**Story:** 1
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: drive a step to completion with a stubbed runner returning `effort: 'high'` under a state whose `complexity_tier` is `M` and assert the emitted `step_completed` carries `effort: 'high'` and `tier: 'M'`; drive a failure and assert `step_failed` carries both; drive a retry and assert `step_retry` carries the currently resolved `model`, `effort`, `provider`, and `tier`; drive events with unresolved dimensions and assert the keys are absent; replay legacy close and retry lines without the new keys through `EventPersister` and `MetricsListener` and assert no throw
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: add optional `effort?: EffortLevel` and `tier?: ComplexityTier` to the `step_completed` and `step_failed` members of `ConductorEvent`; add optional `model`, `effort`, `provider`, and `tier` to `step_retry`; populate retry dimensions from the failed `StepRunResult` and current state, keeping the existing `escalatedModel`/`escalatedEffort` fields for the upcoming attempt
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Emit effort and tier on step close events"

**Done when:**
- The `step_completed` and `step_failed` union members declare optional `effort` (`EffortLevel`) and `tier` (`ComplexityTier`); `step_retry` declares optional `model`, `effort`, `provider`, and `tier`; `EVENT_SINKS` needs no new row because no new member exists
- A conductor test asserts the emitted `step_completed` and `step_failed` payloads carry `effort` and `tier` when the runner result and state supply them, and carry neither key when they do not
- A replay test feeds a `step_completed` record lacking both keys through `EventPersister` and `MetricsListener.start` and asserts both accept it without throwing

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/types/events.ts — two optional fields on two members
- src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts — both emit sites
- src/conductor/test/engine/conductor-step-events.test.ts — new assertions

**Dependencies:** 1

### Task 3: Add the dispatch-dimension attribute seam to MetricsRecorder
**Story:** 2
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: in `metrics.test.ts`, call `onStepClose('build', 10, 0, undefined, undefined, false, { model: 'opus', effort: 'high', provider: 'claude', tier: 'M' })` and assert the duration data point's attribute set is exactly `{ step, model, effort, provider, tier, project, worker, feature }`; call with `{ model: 'opus' }` only and assert no `effort`/`provider`/`tier` keys and no `unknown` value anywhere; assert the closed attribute-name list matches D10
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: export `DispatchDimensions` from `metrics.ts`; add a `dimensions?: DispatchDimensions` parameter to `onStepClose`, `onRetry`, and `onDispatch`; a private `withDimensions(attrs, dims)` copies only defined members, mirroring the optional `model`/`source` handling in `onFeatureCostSnapshot`; `onDispatch` also copies `fallback` when it is a boolean
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Add dispatch dimensions seam to MetricsRecorder"

**Done when:**
- `metrics.ts` exports `DispatchDimensions` and `MetricsRecorder.onStepClose`, `onRetry`, and `onDispatch` accept it, merging only defined members via one private helper
- `metrics.test.ts` asserts the exact attribute key set on a duration point for a fully populated dimension value and asserts key absence (not `unknown`) for each omitted member
- `metrics.test.ts` asserts no attribute key outside `step, metering, model, effort, provider, tier, fallback` plus identity appears on `conductor.step.duration`, `conductor.step.retries`, or `conductor.step.dispatches`

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts — `DispatchDimensions`, helper, three signatures
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics.test.ts — attribute-set assertions

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 4: Carry preferred provider and fallback reason on the dispatch observation
**Story:** 3
**Type:** infrastructure

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: in `dispatch-metering.test.ts`, observe a `provider_attempt` with `preferredProvider: 'codex'` and `fallbackReason: 'codex unavailable'` and assert the observation carries both with `provider: 'claude'`; observe a lifecycle row (`invoked: false`) and assert `undefined`
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: add optional `preferredProvider` to the `provider_attempt` event and populate it at its emit site; add `preferredProvider?` and `fallbackReason?` to `DispatchMeteringObservation`; populate them in `toObservation` from the attempt when present as non-empty strings
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Carry preferred provider and fallback reason on dispatch observations"

**Done when:**
- `provider_attempt` carries optional `preferredProvider`; `DispatchMeteringObservation` declares optional `preferredProvider` and `fallbackReason`, populated by `DispatchMeteringTracker.observe` from that attempt event when non-empty
- `dispatch-metering.test.ts` asserts both fields on the two event shapes and asserts a lifecycle row (`invoked: false`) still yields `undefined`

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/dispatch-metering.ts — two fields
- src/conductor/test/engine/dispatch-metering.test.ts — cases

**Dependencies:** none

### Task 5: Record model, effort, provider, and tier on duration and retries from the listener
**Story:** 2
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: in the listener-based metrics test (extend `no-daemon-level-metrics-queue-depth-halts-and-gate.acceptance.test.ts` or a new `metrics-listener.test.ts`), emit `step_started`, a `provider_attempt` (`provider: 'claude'`, `model: 'opus'`, `invoked: true`, `outcome: 'success'`), and `step_completed` with `model: 'opus'`, `effort: 'high'`, `tier: 'M'`, `actualProvider: 'claude'`; assert the duration point carries `model=opus, effort=high, provider=claude, tier=M`; emit `step_retry` carrying those four dimensions and assert the retries point carries the same four; emit a `step_completed` and a `step_retry` with no dimensions and assert the corresponding keys are absent
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: `MetricsListener` keeps a per-feature `DispatchMeteringTracker`; `onStepClose` builds dimensions from the close event, while the `step_retry` handler builds them directly from the retry event and passes them to the recorder
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Record dispatch dimensions on step duration and retries"

**Done when:**
- `MetricsListener` derives `DispatchDimensions` from each `step_completed`/`step_failed` or `step_retry` occurrence and passes them to `onStepClose` or `onRetry` without cross-event caching
- A listener test asserts `model`, `effort`, `provider`, `tier` on the duration point and on a subsequent retries point for the same step, and asserts absence of `model` and `provider` when the events carry neither
- A listener test asserts a `step_retry` with no prior `step_started` records a retries point with `step` and identity only and does not throw

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — dimension tracking, tracker, retry handler
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics-listener.test.ts — new cases

**Dependencies:** 2, 3, 4

### Task 6: Count dispatches with provider and fallback from a real provider_attempt handler
**Story:** 3
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: in the listener test, emit a `provider_attempt` (`preferredProvider: 'codex'`, `provider: 'claude'`, `invoked: true`, `outcome: 'success'`) and assert exactly one `conductor.step.dispatches` point with `provider=claude`, `fallback=true`, `metering` present; repeat with preferred `claude` and assert `fallback=false`; repeat with no `preferredProvider` and assert `provider` present and no `fallback` key; emit a lifecycle row and assert no dispatch point and no `provider-lifecycle` label value; assert a following completion does not double-count
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: replace the `provider_attempt: () => {}` handler with one that runs the event through the feature's `DispatchMeteringTracker` and, on an observation, calls `recorder.onDispatch(step, tokenUsage, model, dimensions)` where `fallback` is `preferredProvider !== undefined ? preferredProvider !== provider : undefined`; `onStepClose` passes `recordDispatch: false` when the tracker already counted the attempt, else counts the compatibility completion (same rule the interactive path uses)
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Count dispatches with provider and fallback from provider_attempt"

**Done when:**
- `MetricsListener.METRICS_HANDLERS.provider_attempt` calls `MetricsRecorder.onDispatch` for each observation the tracker returns and never for a lifecycle row
- A listener test asserts one `conductor.step.dispatches` point per dispatch with `provider` and `fallback` set to true or false, asserts `fallback` absent when no preferred provider was recorded, and asserts `provider-lifecycle` never appears as a label value
- A listener test asserts a successful attempt followed by its matching `step_completed` yields exactly one dispatch point

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — real handler, single-count rule
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics-listener.test.ts — cases

**Dependencies:** 5

### Task 7: Set dispatch dimension and fallback attributes on the step span
**Story:** 4
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: in `span-manager.test.ts`, open a step, call `onProviderAttempt` with an observation (`provider: 'claude'`, `preferredProvider: 'codex'`, `fallbackReason: 'codex unavailable'`), complete it with `model: 'sonnet'`, `effort: 'medium'`, `tier: 'S'`, `preferredProvider: 'codex'`, `actualProvider: 'claude'`, and assert the exported span carries `conductor.model=sonnet`, `conductor.effort=medium`, `conductor.complexity_tier=S`, `conductor.provider=claude`, `conductor.provider.preferred=codex`, `conductor.fallback=true`, `conductor.fallback.reason='codex unavailable'`; complete a step whose attempt had no `fallbackReason` and assert that key is absent; call `onProviderAttempt` for a step with no open span and assert one warning, no span, no throw
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: add `SpanManager.onProviderAttempt(step, observation)` storing the observation on the open step state; in `onStepCompleted`/`onStepFailed` set the D10 attributes from the event fields and the stored observation, each only when defined; wire the `provider_attempt` case in `otel-visualizer.ts` to call it with the tracker's observation
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Set dispatch dimension attributes on step spans"

**Done when:**
- `SpanManager.onProviderAttempt` stores the observation on the open step state and `onStepCompleted`/`onStepFailed` set `conductor.model`, `conductor.effort`, `conductor.complexity_tier`, `conductor.provider`, `conductor.provider.preferred`, `conductor.fallback`, and `conductor.fallback.reason` only when each source value is defined
- `span-manager.test.ts` asserts the full attribute set on a fallback dispatch span, asserts `conductor.fallback.reason` absent when no reason was reported, and asserts an attempt for a step with no open span produces one warning and no span
- The `OtelVisualizer` `provider_attempt` case forwards the tracker's observation to `SpanManager.onProviderAttempt`

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/span-manager.ts — observation storage, attributes
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts — `provider_attempt` case
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/span-manager.test.ts — cases

**Dependencies:** 2, 4

### Task 8: Export TokenUsage detail as span-only attributes
**Story:** 5
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: in `span-manager.test.ts`, complete a step whose `tokenUsage` has `reasoningOutput: 1200`, `numTurns: 7`, `durationMs: 84000`, `costSource: 'provider'` and assert `conductor.usage.reasoning_output=1200`, `conductor.usage.turns=7`, `conductor.usage.duration_ms=84000`, `conductor.cost.source=provider`; with `costSource: 'rate-card'` assert `rate-card`; with a Codex-shaped usage (no `durationMs`, no `costSource`) assert both keys absent; with no `tokenUsage` assert none of the five keys; with `reasoningOutput: NaN` assert that key absent. In `metrics.test.ts`, after a full step close with that usage, assert no series carries `fallback.reason`, any `usage.*`, or `cost.source`
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: in `onStepCompleted`, set the four usage attributes from `event.tokenUsage` only when the member is present and, for numbers, `Number.isFinite`; touch no metric code path
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Export TokenUsage detail on step spans"

**Done when:**
- `SpanManager.onStepCompleted` sets `conductor.usage.reasoning_output`, `conductor.usage.turns`, `conductor.usage.duration_ms`, and `conductor.cost.source` only for present, finite (`Number.isFinite`) members of `event.tokenUsage`
- `span-manager.test.ts` asserts presence for a full usage, absence of `duration_ms`/`cost.source` for a Codex-shaped usage, absence of all five for no usage, and absence of `reasoning_output` for `NaN`
- `metrics.test.ts` asserts that after a step close with full usage no exported metric series carries `fallback.reason`, `usage.reasoning_output`, `usage.turns`, `usage.duration_ms`, or `cost.source`

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/span-manager.ts — usage attributes
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/span-manager.test.ts — cases
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics.test.ts — span-only guard

**Dependencies:** 7

### Task 9: Prove daemon listener and interactive visualizer emit identical dimension sets
**Story:** 6
**Type:** negative-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: extend `otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts` with a fixture sequence (`step_started`, `provider_attempt`, `step_completed` carrying `model`, `effort`, `tier`, `preferredProvider`, `actualProvider`, `tokenUsage`) replayed through `MetricsListener` and through `OtelVisualizer` (metrics enabled) against two in-memory metric exporters; assert per-instrument attribute key/value sets are equal after stripping identity keys for `step.duration`, `step.retries`, `step.dispatches`; replay with `effort`/`tier` removed and assert both omit them; install a recorder whose `onStepClose` throws and assert both paths swallow it and the emitter still delivers the next event
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: the interactive `OtelVisualizer` builds the same `DispatchDimensions` from its `pendingDispatch` observation plus the `step_completed` fields and passes it to `onStepClose`/`onDispatch`/`onRetry`; the shared builder lives in `metrics.ts` (`dispatchDimensionsFrom(event, observation)`) and both paths call it
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Prove listener and visualizer dimension parity"

**Done when:**
- `metrics.ts` exports one `dispatchDimensionsFrom(event, observation)` builder and both `MetricsListener` and `OtelVisualizer` obtain their `DispatchDimensions` from it
- `otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts` replays one fixture through both paths and asserts equal attribute sets per instrument for duration, retries, and dispatches, and asserts both omit `effort` and `tier` when the fixture lacks them
- `otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts` asserts a throwing recorder is swallowed on both paths and the following event is still delivered

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts — `dispatchDimensionsFrom`
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts — use the builder
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts — use the builder
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel-visualizer-parity.test.ts — fixture replay

**Dependencies:** 6, 8

### Task 10: Interactive dispatch recording passes model and dimensions instead of dropping them
**Story:** 6
**Type:** happy-path

**Steps:**
1. Write failing test: in `otel-visualizer.test.ts`, drive `provider_attempt` then `step_completed` with `model: 'opus'`, `preferredProvider: 'codex'`, `actualProvider: 'claude'` through a metrics-enabled visualizer and assert the `conductor.step.dispatches` point carries `model=opus`, `provider=claude`, `fallback=true`; assert the duration point carries `model=opus` and `provider=claude`
2. Verify test fails (RED)
3. Implement: in the `OtelVisualizer` `provider_attempt` case and the `SpanManager` `onStepClose` callback, pass `dispatchDimensionsFrom(...)` to `onDispatch` and `onStepClose`; remove the unused `_model` parameter path in `MetricsRecorder.onDispatch` in favour of the dimensions value
4. Verify test passes (GREEN)
5. Commit with message: "Pass dispatch dimensions through the interactive OTel path"

**Done when:**
- The `OtelVisualizer` `provider_attempt` case calls `onDispatch` with a `DispatchDimensions` carrying `model`, `provider`, and `fallback`, and its step-close callback passes the same value to `onStepClose`
- `otel-visualizer.test.ts` asserts `model`, `provider`, and `fallback=true` on the interactive `conductor.step.dispatches` point and `model` and `provider` on the interactive duration point

**Files likely touched:**
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.ts — pass dimensions
- src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts — `onDispatch` reads dimensions
- src/conductor/test/engine/otel/otel-visualizer.test.ts — cases

| Story 5 happy: Given a completed step whose `TokenUsage` has `reasoningOutput: 1200`, `numTurns: 7`, `durationMs: 84000`, `costSource: 'provider'`, when the span closes, then the span carries `conductor.usage.reasoning_output=1200`, `conductor.usage.turns=7`, `conductor.usage.duration_ms=84000`, `conductor.cost.source=provider` | 8 | "asserts presence for a full usage" | diff-local |
| Story 5 happy: Given a completed step whose cost came from the rate card, when the span closes, then the span carries `conductor.cost.source=rate-card` | 8 | "asserts presence for a full usage" | diff-local |
| Story 5 negative: Given a Codex dispatch whose `TokenUsage` has no `durationMs` and no `costSource`, when the span closes, then neither `conductor.usage.duration_ms` nor `conductor.cost.source` is present and no zero is written | 8 | "absence of `duration_ms`/`cost.source` for a Codex-shaped usage" | diff-local |
| Story 5 negative: Given a completed step with no `tokenUsage` at all, when the span closes, then no `conductor.usage.*` or `conductor.cost.source` attribute is present | 8 | "absence of all five for no usage" | diff-local |

| Story 6 happy: Given one recorded event sequence (`step_started`, `provider_attempt`, `step_completed` with model, effort, tier, providers), when it is replayed through the daemon metrics listener and through the interactive visualizer against two in-memory metric exporters, then the duration, retries, and dispatches data points have identical attribute key/value sets on both paths (identity attributes aside) | 9 | "asserts equal attribute sets per instrument for duration, retries, and dispatches" | diff-local |
| Story 6 negative: Given the same sequence with `effort` and `tier` removed from `step_completed`, when replayed through both paths, then both omit `effort` and `tier` and neither substitutes a default | 9 | "asserts both omit `effort` and `tier` when the fixture lacks them" | diff-local |
| Story 6 negative: Given a metrics handler that throws while merging attributes, when the event is delivered, then the failure is swallowed as best-effort on both paths and the run continues | 9 | "asserts a throwing recorder is swallowed on both paths and the following event is still delivered" | diff-local |

## Architecture Obligation Coverage

| Decision | Disposition | Task(s) | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| adr-014-otel-observability-exporter#D1 | no-change | none | The exporter stays a bus listener; this feature adds fields at two existing emit sites but subscribes through the same `otelEventTypes()` rows and adds no subscription elsewhere |

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab1-1: src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:195-203 — stop applying `fallback` in the shared `withDimensions` helper for the step-duration and step-retries instruments: derive the per-instrument allowed dimension keys from one source so duration/retries take only model, effort, provider, tier while dispatches additionally takes fallback, keeping the existing onDispatch fallback behaviour that plan Task 6 delivered; this closes all three leaking sites at metrics.ts:109 (duration), metrics.ts:110 (retries via onStepClose) and metrics.ts:127 (retries via onRetry)
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** Verified (95%): ADR-014 D10 permits `fallback` only as an additional label on conductor.step.dispatches, but src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:201 copies `fallback` inside the single `withDimensions` helper, which feeds the duration histogram and retries counter at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:109-110 and the retries counter again at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:127; the listener merges a complete dimensions object (including `fallback`) into close attributes at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts:137,163, so a fallback dispatch leaks the label onto duration and retries. Approved architecture is unchanged and authoritative — this is conforming implementation drift, not an architectural question. Class sweep: all three non-dispatch sites are fed by the one helper, so the repair is made there rather than at each call site; the matched-pair counterpart is the closed attribute-name list asserted at src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics.test.ts:122, which currently permits `fallback` on all three instruments and is brought along in the same task so the enumeration and the placement contract cannot drift. No coverage is removed: the dispatch-side `fallback` assertions delivered by plan Task 6 at src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics-listener.test.ts:113-114 and the fully populated duration/retries assertions delivered by plan Task 3 at src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics.test.ts:124-126 both survive unchanged. Found and deliberately excluded: the two stale Mermaid node labels the review names as non-blocking live in a sealed architecture artifact owned by DECIDE, and no active plan task admits editing it, so they are not tasked here. Plan Task 3 was examined and does not admit this remedy — its Done-when explicitly allows `fallback` in the duration/retries key list — so this is appended remediation work rather than an existing-task binding.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab1-2: src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics.test.ts:92-131 — extend the existing 'records only defined dispatch dimensions on step metric attributes' case (do not modify its current duration/retries/dispatches expectations) by passing `fallback: true` in the dimensions value and asserting the conductor.step.duration and conductor.step.retries points have no `fallback` key while the conductor.step.dispatches point carries `fallback: true`; replace the single union allowlist at line 122 with per-instrument allowed key lists so the enumeration matches the D10 placement contract instead of permitting fallback everywhere
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** Verified (95%): ADR-014 D10 permits `fallback` only as an additional label on conductor.step.dispatches, but src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:201 copies `fallback` inside the single `withDimensions` helper, which feeds the duration histogram and retries counter at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:109-110 and the retries counter again at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:127; the listener merges a complete dimensions object (including `fallback`) into close attributes at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts:137,163, so a fallback dispatch leaks the label onto duration and retries.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab1-3: src/conductor/test/engine/otel/metrics-listener.test.ts — add a listener case emitting step_started, a provider_attempt with preferredProvider 'codex' and provider 'claude' (invoked true), a step_retry, and step_completed, asserting the duration and retries points omit `fallback` while the dispatches point keeps `fallback: true`; leave the existing cases at lines 43-75 and 77-115 untouched so their delivered coverage survives
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** Verified (95%): ADR-014 D10 permits `fallback` only as an additional label on conductor.step.dispatches, but src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:201 copies `fallback` inside the single `withDimensions` helper, which feeds the duration histogram and retries counter at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:109-110 and the retries counter again at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:127; the listener merges a complete dimensions object (including `fallback`) into close attributes at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts:137,163, so a fallback dispatch leaks the label onto duration and retries.

**Rationale:** Verified (95%): ADR-014 D10 permits `fallback` only as an additional label on conductor.step.dispatches, but src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:201 copies `fallback` inside the single `withDimensions` helper, which feeds the duration histogram and retries counter at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:109-110 and the retries counter again at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics.ts:127; the listener merges a complete dimensions object (including `fallback`) into close attributes at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts:137,163, so a fallback dispatch leaks the label onto duration and retries.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab1-tier-1: src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts — thread the current run tier into both auxiliary provider dispatches from the single ConductState runDispatch already holds at line 781: give runBuildReview() (line 2628) and runRubricBuildReview() (line 2001) a tier parameter supplied by the runDispatch call at line 796, pass tier to executeAuxiliaryProviderCandidates at line 2278, and pass the same state.complexity_tier to executeAuxiliaryProviderCandidates at line 2572 for coverage binding; leave the unrelated claim-assembly read at line 2513 unchanged so the two telemetry callers derive tier from one source and cannot drift
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** Verified (97%): ADR-014 D10 requires tier on conductor.step.dispatches, but the two auxiliary production dispatches drop an available value before provider_attempt is built — the build-review rubric executor at src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts:2278 and the coverage-binding executor at src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts:2572 both call executeAuxiliaryProviderCandidates with no tier field, so executeProviderCandidates passes undefined at src/conductor/src/engine/provider-execution.ts:718 and the builder omits the key at src/conductor/src/engine/provider-execution.ts:523; MetricsListener records the dispatch point immediately at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts:137, so no later completion can amend it. The approved architecture is unchanged and authoritative and the review states the design does not prevent the outcome, so this is conforming implementation drift routed to build, not an architectural question. Class sweep: grep over src/engine finds exactly two executeAuxiliaryProviderCandidates call sites (step-runners.ts:2278 and :2572) and both are repaired in the same task; ExecuteAuxiliaryProviderCandidatesInput already inherits tier from ExecuteProviderCandidatesInput (it is not in the Omit list at src/conductor/src/engine/provider-execution.ts:789-793), so no type change is needed. Matched pair: the two auxiliary callers must agree on the tier value, so both read state.complexity_tier from the one ConductState runDispatch already holds at src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts:781-796 rather than each recomputing it — coverage binding's existing state.complexity_tier ?? 'M' read at src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts:2513 stays untouched because it feeds claim assembly, not telemetry. No coverage is removed: every existing rubric and coverage-binding dispatch assertion survives, and the change is additive field population. Found and deliberately excluded: the two stale Mermaid node labels the review records as non-blocking live in a sealed architecture artifact owned by DECIDE and no active plan task admits editing it. Plan tasks 1-10 were examined and none admits this remedy — tasks 2, 5 and 6 govern conductor.ts close/retry emit sites and the listener, task 4 governs preferredProvider on the attempt builder, and no task reaches the auxiliary step-runner callers — so this is appended remediation work rather than an existing-task binding.

### Task rem-as-built-rem-ab1-tier-2: src/conductor/test/engine/step-runners.test.ts — add cases asserting the provider_attempt metadata captured via onAttempt carries tier for BOTH auxiliary paths: a build_review rubric dispatch and a coverage_binding dispatch, each run with state.complexity_tier set (assert the value round-trips) and each run with complexity_tier undefined (assert the tier key is absent, matching the conditional spread at src/conductor/src/engine/provider-execution.ts:523); add both cases rather than one so neither caller can regress alone, and modify no existing assertion in the file
**Gate:** as-built
**Rationale:** Verified (97%): ADR-014 D10 requires tier on conductor.step.dispatches, but the two auxiliary production dispatches drop an available value before provider_attempt is built — the build-review rubric executor at src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts:2278 and the coverage-binding executor at src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts:2572 both call executeAuxiliaryProviderCandidates with no tier field, so executeProviderCandidates passes undefined at src/conductor/src/engine/provider-execution.ts:718 and the builder omits the key at src/conductor/src/engine/provider-execution.ts:523; MetricsListener records the dispatch point immediately at src/conductor/src/engine/otel/metrics-listener.ts:137, so no later completion can amend it.
