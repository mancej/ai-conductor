# Architecture: Harness Daemon Profile — build-to-PR enablement (#174)

**Last updated:** 2026-07-03
**Scope:** Completes daemon build-to-PR on the harness repo itself (issue #174): (1) a committed
`bin/setup` so daemon build worktrees get a working `src/conductor` toolchain, and (2) semver
escalation inside the existing `VersionApprovalGate` — PATCH-class change sets auto-pass (CI cuts
the patch on merge), MINOR/MAJOR signals or an undeterminable change set HALT for a human semver
decision. Extends `2026-06-30-harness-self-host-guardrails.md`; every invariant there
(HALT-based gates, daemon never merges — ADR-005/ADR-010) is preserved. New elements marked **[NEW]**.

## Diagram 2 — Sequence: self-build worktree prep + escalated version gate

```mermaid

  autonumber
  participant D as Daemon runner
  participant P as prepareWorktree
  participant BS as bin/setup «NEW»
  participant B as Sandboxed build
  participant VG as VersionApprovalGate
  participant SC as SemverSignalClassifier «NEW»
  participant H as HALT marker
  participant O as Operator

  D->>P: worktree created for spec «slug»
  P->>BS: run bin/setup (CI=true, WORKTREE_NAMESPACE)
  BS->>BS: npm install + npm run build in src/conductor
  BS-->>P: exit 0 (non-zero keeps worktree, feature errored)
  P-->>D: worktree ready
  D->>B: dispatch build steps (relink + sandbox, unchanged)
  B->>VG: finish gates begin
  VG->>VG: approved marker present and equal to VERSION?
  alt marker approved
    VG-->>B: pass (existing behavior, unchanged)
  else no marker
    VG->>SC: classify change set vs base branch
    alt PATCH class only
      SC-->>VG: auto-pass, CI cuts patch on merge
    else MINOR or MAJOR signal, or undeterminable
      SC->>H: HALT naming the signal and the files that raised it
      O-->>VG: sets VERSION or writes version-approval, clears HALT
    end
  end
  VG->>B: continue to ReleaseArtifactGate then open PR
  Note over O: operator reviews and merges — daemon never merges
```

> **Amended 2026-09-15 by #1775:** James Stoup approved clarifying the historical `clears HALT` arrow above: after addressing the reported gate reason and committing the fix, clear both `.pipeline/HALT` and `.pipeline/HALT.class`. The daemon re-dispatches and re-runs required gates before opening or updating the PR; the operator merges after checks pass. Re-install and `/verify` are not generic recovery steps. The authoritative [current recovery sequence](2026-06-30-harness-self-host-guardrails.md#current-recovery-sequence-approved-2026-09-15) preserves fail-closed gates and human merge ownership.


## Legend

- **[NEW] / «NEW»** — elements introduced by this feature (green fill in Diagram 1).
- **bin/setup** — the repo's conventional post-worktree-creation hook, already invoked by
  `prepareWorktree` for every daemon worktree when present; this feature commits one for the
  harness repo itself. Non-zero exit throws: the worktree is kept and the feature marked errored.
- **SemverSignalClassifier** — pure function over the build branch's change set vs its base.
  MAJOR reuses the existing `classifyBreakingSurfaces` surfaces (bin/conduct, bin/install,
  hooks/, settings schema, removed/renamed skills); MINOR detects additive skill/hook/gate
  surface (new `skills/*/SKILL.md`, new hook file, new gate registration); anything it cannot
  classify is treated as HALT-worthy (fail-closed). It never edits `VERSION` — the human does.
- **Existing marker override** — `.pipeline/version-approval` matching `VERSION` still passes the
  gate unconditionally, so the operator's manual approval path is unchanged.
