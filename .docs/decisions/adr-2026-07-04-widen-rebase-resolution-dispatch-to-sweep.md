# ADR: Widen the Rebase-Resolution Dispatch Exception to the Mergeable Sweep

**Status:** APPROVED
**Date:** 2026-07-04
**Amends:** adr-2026-06-29-rebase-conflict-resolution-dispatch
**Related:** adr-001-rebase-insertion-mechanism, adr-2026-07-03-post-rebase-force-with-lease

## Context

adr-2026-06-29-rebase-conflict-resolution-dispatch narrowed ADR-001's engine-native rule with
exactly one sanctioned prompt-dispatch site: the `conflict_halt` sub-path of `runRebaseStep`
(finish time, before a PR first opens). Intake #247 extends conflict resolution to PRs that are
**already open**: the mergeable sweep detects a watched PR gone CONFLICTING and must be able to
run the same bounded resolution.

## Options

- **A. Re-dispatch the whole feature through the daemon loop** — heavyweight; re-runs build
  machinery to fix a merge conflict; conflates "conflicting PR" with "failed build".
- **B. Second sanctioned call site for the existing sub-loop (chosen)** — the sweep's
  CONFLICTING path invokes the same `resolveRebaseConflicts` loop (same cap from
  resolved-config, same short-circuit, same FR-8/FR-9 acceptance guards) inside a dedicated
  resolution worktree, preceded by the deterministic Tier 1 resolvers.
- **C. New independent resolution engine for open PRs** — duplicates a tested, guarded loop;
  two policies to keep in sync.

## Decision

Option B. The dispatch exception now has **two** sanctioned call sites — `runRebaseStep`
(finish time) and the mergeable sweep's CONFLICTING path — and no others. Everything around
the prompt stays engine-native: detection (GitHub merge state via `prMergeState`), the
deterministic Tier 1 resolvers (CHANGELOG re-append — existing; `.docs` keep-both — new,
scoped strictly to `.docs/` paths), the acceptance guards, the suite gate, and the
lease-protected push. Tier 2 dispatch fires only when Tier 1 leaves conflicts, bounded by the
same configured cap (default 3).

> **Amended 2026-09-20 by #2607 (operator decision):** "One resolution policy, two entry points" gains one bounded divergence. No third dispatch site is added.
>
> **D1** Sweep-only test-only judgement. The sweep call site alone may dispatch the resolver with the test-only supersession exception of adr-2026-08-01-rebase-full-replay-intent-validation in force, and alone applies the declared-drop excusal of adr-2026-06-29-rebase-conflict-resolution-dispatch. Cap, Tier 1, the suite gate, and the lease-protected push are unchanged and still precede publication. After a publication that used the exception, the engine records the verdict on the pull request, naming the choice, the rationale, the declared-superseded commits, and the verification command that passed, and emits it on the existing event spine. Nothing is published unless that verification is named and passed.
>
> **D1.1** (Amended 2026-09-23, operator decision) The pull-request record is best-effort after a successful lease-protected push. If posting it fails, the push is not reverted, the failure is logged, and the verdict event on the existing event spine is the durable record of the choice.

## Consequences

- One resolution policy, two entry points; fixes and strategy improvements apply to both.
- ADR-001's principle survives: prompts resolve conflicts, engines decide everything else.
- The sweep gains a minutes-scale work item; bounded to one resolution per tick, after the
  label pass (review Condition 3).
- Any future third dispatch site requires another amending ADR.
