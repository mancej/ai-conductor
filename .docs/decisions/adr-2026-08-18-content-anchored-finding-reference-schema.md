# ADR: Finding-identity references are content-anchored; a closed class-level reference schema for all four rubrics

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Status:** APPROVED
**Approved:** Operator-approved 2026-08-18
**Deciders:** James Stoup (operator) and architecture review amendment pass for #1611 / intake #1695
**Depends on:** `adr-2026-08-13-stable-build-review-finding-dispositions` (Option C typed identity — this ADR fills its "every rubric needs a carefully designed identity schema" obligation class-level)
**Reuses:** `adr-2026-08-16-closed-build-review-finding-vocabularies` (closed classification sets; this ADR is the closed *reference* counterpart)

## Context

`adr-2026-08-13` chose versioned typed finding identities (rubric + concernKind + anchor
references, hashed) but deliberately left each rubric's reference schema to be "carefully
designed." In practice that design happened incrementally in BUILD: successive
`build_review` laps of feature #1611 found each not-yet-canonical anchor field, and the
remediation planner authored a new reference grammar per lap — plan-task id grammar,
tautology test selectors (`rem-rootcause-7`), and finally a line-coordinate rootCause
hunk locus `path@oldStart,oldCount:newStart,newCount` (`rem-rootcause-9/10`, commit
`d8fa79150`) — 21 appended tasks against an 18-task plan, with no operator checkpoint
(intake #1695). The operator rejected and reverted the line-coordinate locus.

Forces:

- **Identity must survive wording drift** (the #1611 defect) — references, never prose.
- **Identity must survive rebases.** The sibling feature
  `rubric-cache-identity-is-sha-anchored-so-a-rebase-` (plan 2026-08-15) already ruled
  the same way for the rubric cache: content-only identity, because SHA- and
  coordinate-anchored identity breaks on every rebase that leaves content unchanged.
  Line-coordinate loci re-import exactly that fragility into finding identity: a clean
  rebase renumbers hunks, drifting every open finding's id and detaching accepted
  dispositions — recreating #1611 through the mechanism built to fix it.
- **The schema must be closed class-level.** A field-by-field schema invites the
  observed failure: each unspecified field becomes a future finding and an unapproved
  grammar. The vocabulary ADR (`adr-2026-08-16`) already established the pattern:
  closed, corpus-validated sets, bound by an integrity check.
- **Dispositions suppress findings**, so identity must not over-match: an identity that
  survives a *content* change would let an accepted disposition silently swallow a
  materially different defect at the same location.

## Options Considered

### Option A: Enumerated per-field canonical grammars (status-quo trajectory)

Each anchor field gets a bespoke validated string grammar (path refs, task-id grammar,
test-selector strings, coordinate loci), added as rubrics discover them.

- **Pros:** Fully mechanical; each grammar is precise; incremental delivery.
- **Cons:** The schema is open-ended by construction — the lap-by-lap enumeration and
  unapproved grammar authoring already observed; coordinate-bearing grammars are
  rebase-fragile; every new grammar is an identity-semantics change that invalidates
  existing dispositions.

### Option B: Content-anchored references (closed three-kind schema)

Every anchor reference is exactly one of three canonical kinds, uniform across rubrics;
no other reference kind may be introduced without superseding this ADR.

- **Pros:** Class-level and closed — no future field can demand a new grammar without an
  operator-approved supersession; rebase-stable (content survives a clean rebase;
  coordinates do not); content change ⇒ new identity, which is the correct fail-closed
  narrowness for dispositions; symmetric with the cache's approved content-only identity.
- **Cons:** Content hashes are opaque in reports (mitigated: the canonical payload
  retains the human-readable display string alongside the hash); a conflict-resolved
  rebase that edits hunk content yields a new identity (accepted: edited content is a
  new judgement subject).

### Option C: Judged equivalence at match time

Keep coarse references (rubric + concernKind + path) and let a schema-constrained LLM
judgement decide "same finding?" when matching dispositions.

- **Pros:** No grammar maintenance ever; matches the judgement-shaped nature of
  equivalence.
- **Cons:** A non-deterministic matcher guards a suppression gate — an over-matching
  judge silently swallows new defects, the exact narrowness violation
  `adr-2026-08-13` rejected in its Option A/B analysis; per-lap judge cost on the
  daemon critical path. (Deferred, not forbidden: a judged *near-miss advisory* — same
  rubric/concernKind/file, different content hash — may later flag "possibly the same
  concern" to the operator without auto-matching; that belongs to the #1630 arbitration
  design and is out of scope here.)

## Decision

Choose **Option B**. The canonical reference schema for all four rubrics is the closed
set of exactly three reference kinds:

1. **`path`** — a repository-relative file path (existing
   `parseBuildReviewCanonicalPathReference` grammar).
2. **`plan-task`** — a plan task id (existing shared `TASK_ID_PATTERN` grammar).
3. **`content-region`** — `{ path, contentHash, display }` where `contentHash` is
   `sha256` of the referenced region's **normalized content** (the changed test's full
   title text for tautology `changedTest`; the projected hunk's added+removed line
   content, whitespace-normalized, for rootCause `locus`), and `display` is the
   human-readable form carried for reports but **excluded from the identity hash**.

Rubric anchor bindings: tautology `changedTest` → content-region (test-title content);
scope `path` → path; rootCause `locus` → content-region (hunk content); completeness
`planTask` → plan-task, `missingSurface` → path. Coordinate encodings (line numbers,
hunk offsets, byte ranges) are forbidden in any reference kind. Any future anchor field
must bind to one of these three kinds; introducing a fourth kind requires superseding
this ADR with operator approval — it is never a BUILD-time or remediation-lap decision.

Why: it is the only option that is simultaneously closed (ends the per-lap grammar
enumeration), rebase-stable (per the cache precedent), and fail-closed narrow for
dispositions (content change ⇒ new identity), while staying inside
`adr-2026-08-13`'s Option C typed-identity architecture rather than superseding it.

## Consequences

- `rem-rootcause-9/10` are reimplemented against this schema (content-hashed hunk
  regions), not the reverted coordinate loci; the revert `8977ba7c7` stands.
- Existing v1/v2 identities parsed under `allowLegacyV1` remain readable; new findings
  bind to this schema under the next contract version. Changing a binding later is an
  intentional identity-semantics change per `adr-2026-08-13`.
- An integrity test must pin the three-kind set and the per-rubric bindings (the same
  binding pattern `adr-2026-08-16` Condition D5 uses for vocabularies), so a new
  reference kind cannot land silently.
- Verified claims: current per-rubric anchor shapes and locus parsing read from
  `build-review-finding-identity.ts` / `build-review-domain.ts` at HEAD (verified);
  coordinate fragility under rebase and content stability under clean rebase —
  inferred from git rebase semantics, 95%, corroborated by the approved content-only
  cache-identity plan (2026-08-15). No unconfirmed load-bearing assumptions remain.

> **Amended 2026-08-18 at `architecture_review` (remediation `rem-rootcause-11`, from
> `build_review` lap `58c87dce4`):** the authoritative `rootCause.locus` contract is
> stated here and nowhere else. `locus` binds to **`content-region`** —
> `{ path, contentHash, display }` where `contentHash` is `sha256` of the projected
> hunk's added+removed line content, whitespace-normalized, and `display` is excluded
> from the identity hash. Two same-class `rootCause` findings in distinct hunks of one
> changed file therefore canonicalize to distinct identities, while a pure rewording of
> either finding's prose changes neither. No other locus encoding is authoritative.
>
> **Plan tasks `rem-rootcause-9` and `rem-rootcause-10` are retired, not deferred.**
> Their steps prescribe the line-coordinate selector
> `path@oldStart,oldCount:newStart,newCount` that the operator rejected and `8977ba7c7`
> reverted; the Decision above forbids coordinate encodings in every reference kind, so
> those steps are unimplementable as written and no later step may carry them forward or
> reintroduce the mechanism. What survives them is their *outcome* — a `rootCause` locus

> re-authors as RED/GREEN tasks bound to `content-region` above. Until those replacement
> tasks exist, no distinct-hunk implementation is authorized: the earlier absence of this
> ruling is what let a remediation lap invent an unapproved grammar in the first place.

> **Amended 2026-08-18 (operator, resolving stall:changed-test-title):** the authoritative
> source of tautology `changedTest` title content is the changed test's **full declared
> title chain** — the concatenated `describe`/`it` (or framework-equivalent) titles as
> written in the test source at the graded head — extracted at **snapshot time** and
> carried in the frozen build-review projection as a `changedTestTitles` entry
> `{ selector, titleText }` alongside the existing `changedTestSelectors`. The
> content-region reference for `changedTest` is then
> `{ path: selector, contentHash: sha256(whitespace-normalized titleText), display: titleText }`.
> Graders never re-derive titles from the working tree; the projection is the only source,
> preserving snapshot immutability. A changed test whose titles cannot be statically
> extracted falls back to hashing the selector path and is flagged in the projection so
> the grader may treat identity as coarse for that entry (fail-open on identity precision,
> never on execution).

> **Amended 2026-08-18 (operator, superseding approval for equal-content disambiguation):**
> a `content-region` reference MAY carry an optional `occurrence` field — the 0-based
> ordinal of this region among regions of the SAME path (rootCause) or the same full
> title chain (tautology `changedTest`) whose normalized content hashes are equal,
> ordered by frozen-projection order. `occurrence` participates in the identity hash;
> occurrence 0 hashes identically to an omitted field, so unique regions keep their
> existing identities. This is a content-stable disambiguator assigned within
> equal-content groups — NOT a coordinate encoding (no line numbers, offsets, or byte
> ranges), and NOT a fourth reference kind. Selector renames with unchanged titles
> retain identity when the title chain is unique; among genuine duplicates, identity
> follows projection order, which is the accepted precision limit. This amendment is
> the operator approval the base ADR requires for identity-semantics changes.


> **Amended 2026-08-22 by #1805:** rubric membership is now the registry with test-quality as the only member (default off), an empty enabled set is a valid no-dispatch PASS, and retired rubric keys are accepted as no-ops; four-rubric enumerations here narrow to the registry (adr-2026-08-22-build-review-opt-in-rubric-container).

> **Amended 2026-09-06 by #2231:** adr-2026-09-06-engine-owned-test-quality-scope decision 8 preserves declared-title/content-region/occurrence identity, including explicitly coarse fallback where a title cannot be recovered. Coarse identity no longer constitutes whole-file scope authority: only the concrete candidate resolved against pinned source and an approved binding may use it. Source coordinates may locate evidence but are not canonical identity inputs. Input projection v3 separates target authority from identity precision.
