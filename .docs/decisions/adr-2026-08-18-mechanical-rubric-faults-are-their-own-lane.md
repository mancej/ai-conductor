# ADR: A mechanical rubric fault is its own lane — non-charging retry, then an operator reduced-coverage decision

**Date:** 2026-08-18
**Status:** APPROVED
**Approved:** Operator-approved 2026-08-18
**Deciders:** Engineer (DECIDE phase, jstoup111/ai-conductor#1629), operator-confirmed — including an
explicit operator direction, after reading both texts, that the new decision be a **distinct record
kind rather than an amendment** to `adr-2026-08-13`'s refusal list.

**Conforms to:** `adr-2026-08-13-stable-build-review-finding-dispositions` (decisions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 —
this ADR adds a record kind to that store and does **not** relax its finding-acceptance rules),
`adr-2026-08-16-closed-build-review-finding-vocabularies` (D1's rule that no identity input is free
text; D3's `absent` reclassification), `adr-2026-08-17-build-review-rubric-repetition-short-circuit`
(D3 explicitly reserves the mechanical-fault lane to this issue).

**Reuses:** `adr-2026-08-06-bounded-progress-allowance-for-finish-publication` (a non-charging
re-entry must carry its own allowance), `adr-2026-07-13-retry-classify-rerun-vs-route` (the
rerun-vs-route classification and its `absent` mapping), `adr-2026-07-01-machine-scoped-operator-identity`
and `adr-2026-08-09-operator-only-scoped-artifact-reseal` (the operator-only authority standard),
`adr-2026-07-28-total-halt-classification-legacy-boundary` (halt classification),
`adr-2026-08-08-finish-human-required-halt-rendering` (halt body rendering).

**Supersedes:** nothing.

**Does not change:** any rubric's PASS/FAIL judgement; finding identity or the finding-acceptance
rules of `adr-2026-08-13` §2/§4 (an infrastructure failure remains un-acceptable *as a finding*, and
`accept` keeps refusing it); `MAX_KICKBACKS_PER_GATE`; `MAX_CUMULATIVE_KICKBACKS_BUILD_REVIEW`'s value
or its cap value; `adr-2026-08-17`'s `rubricFailures` tally, whose D3 already excludes mechanical
faults; the `skipped` branch's existing non-blocking treatment.

## Context

Issue #1629. On 2026-08-16 two features reached terminal states from mechanical faults rather than
review judgement.

**Incident 1 — a verdict no operator act can clear.** A rename in the diff made the tautology
preflight fail on every lap. With every graded finding operator-accepted, `findings` reported
`Effective verdict: FAIL / Unresolved findings: none` — a state naming no remaining work and offering
no action that resolves it. Recovery took a docs-history rewrite, a plan amendment and a reseal.

**Incident 2 — the semantic cap spent by $0 faults.** A stale worktree missing the rubric skills
produced `Unknown command: /build-review-tautology` dispatch failures (0 turns, ~20ms, $0.00 each).
Each incremented the same cumulative counter as a semantic FAIL; the feature halted at
`cumulative 6, cap 5` without one graded lap.

### What the code actually does (verified 2026-08-18, at this branch's merge base)

Confidence **95%, basis: verified** — each claim below was read in source.

- `deriveEffectiveBuildReviewVerdict` (`build-review-aggregate.ts:243`) returns PASS only when
  `judgedCount > 0 && unresolved.length === 0 && infrastructure.length === 0`. **`skipped` does not
  block.** The docstring at `:206` ("skips/infrastructure failures remain blocking") overstates the
  blocking set; only the infrastructure branch blocks. Reduced coverage is therefore already
  representable in this reducer — what is missing is an authorized way to reach it.
- The cumulative counter is bumped at `conductor.ts:7709` (`consumeKickbackBudget('build_review', …)`)
  on **any** published raw FAIL. `bumpKickbackGate` (`kickback-ledger.ts:170`) is cause-blind: it sees
  a reason string, never a result kind.
- A narrow no-publish path already exists. `step-runners.ts:1828-1852` returns a step failure without
  publishing an aggregate for exactly one fault — `invalid-provider-result` whose `detail` starts
  `judged-result contract not satisfied after one repair turn:` — with the comment: "completion
  deliberately classifies a missing verdict as `absent`, which re-dispatches this rubric without
  consuming the build_review kickback budget." Incident 2's fault escaped it only because its
  `detail` did not match that prefix.
- `BuildReviewInfrastructureFailureReason` (`build-review-domain.ts:19-28`) is **already a closed
  eight-member vocabulary**: `provider-error`, `retry-exhausted`, `missing-artifact`,
  `malformed-artifact`, `stale-artifact`, `identity-mismatch`, `preflight-failed`,
  `artifact-read-failed`. `detail` is free text.
- **The closed vocabulary is being thrown away at the boundary.** The coordinator's branch type
  (`build-review-coordinator.ts:74-79`) carries `reason: string`, and `step-runners.ts:1863-1869`
  folds every non-cache branch into `reason: 'provider-error'` with the real cause pushed into free
  text: `detail: \`${branch.reason}: ${branch.detail}\``. The tautology preflight's own closed
  13-member reason set (`build-review-tautology-preflight.ts:118`), including
  `missing-merge-base-file` from incident 1, never reaches the result. `preflight-failed` is a
  declared member that nothing currently produces.
- `.pipeline/build-review-dispositions.json` is feature-scoped, leased, atomically written, and
  deliberately survives removal of `.pipeline/build-review.json` (`adr-2026-08-13` §2, §3).

## Decision

### D1 — A mechanical fault is classified apart at every routing seam

Mechanical faults route on **result kind**, never on reason text. The classification input is
`BuildReviewRubricResult.kind === 'infrastructure-failure'`, which the strict aggregate parser
already guarantees. No routing decision in this ADR reads `detail`, and no `detail` prefix match
survives: the narrow `startsWith('judged-result contract not satisfied…')` test at
`step-runners.ts:1830` is replaced by the kind check, which is what it was approximating.

### D2 — Preserve the closed cause across the boundary

The branch→result mapping stops collapsing distinct classes into `provider-error`. Each coordinator
branch reason maps to the closed result member that names its class — preflight faults to
`preflight-failed`, artifact write/read faults to their existing artifact members — and the specific
sub-reason continues to travel in `detail` for the human report only. This is a prerequisite for D4:
an identity keyed on a reason that is always `provider-error` would not discriminate at all.

The mapping is total and closed at the type level; an unmapped branch reason is a contract defect
caught at authoring time, never silently coerced.

### D3 — A mechanical fault does not publish an aggregate, and does not charge the semantic budget (OQ-2)

A lap with any mechanical fault and remaining mechanical allowance publishes **no** aggregate. The
step returns failure; completion classifies the verdict `absent`; `build_review` re-runs. This is not
a new mechanism — it is `adr-2026-07-13`'s existing build_review mapping ("Missing / stale / malformed
→ `absent`"), already extended to a contract-violation class by `adr-2026-08-16` D3 step 4 with the
identical rationale: "No kickback budget is consumed and no cap advances on a contract violation."
A mechanical fault is the same category of non-judgement.

Because nothing is published, `consumeKickbackBudget` is never reached on such a lap. `cumulative`,
`count`, and `adr-2026-08-17`'s `rubricFailures` are all untouched by construction rather than by a
new exemption branch — which is why this discharges FR-2 without a second counter inside
`bumpKickbackGate`.

### D4 — The mechanical allowance is its own bounded counter (OQ-3)

Per `adr-2026-08-06`, a non-charging re-entry owes its own termination proof. A **total mechanical
allowance** — a counter of laps that ended in a non-publishing mechanical fault, checked against a
fixed ceiling — discharges it. The counter records the rubric and closed reason last seen so the halt
names where the run stopped.

`MAX_MECHANICAL_FAULT_LAPS_BUILD_REVIEW = 3`. Confidence **70%, basis: inferred** — no measured
corpus of mechanical-fault laps exists, unlike `adr-2026-08-17`'s 11-feature sweep. The derivation is
that both #1629 incidents were **deterministic and environmental**: a rename that stays in the diff
and a worktree that stays stale reproduce on every lap, so a transient-absorbing allowance buys
nothing while each lap costs real provider spend on the other three rubrics. Three admits one
transient plus a confirmation and stops. A per-rubric cap is deliberately **not** part of this
decision, following `adr-2026-08-06`'s holding that "the allowance alone discharges the termination
obligation" and that a second counter is a diagnostic refinement, not a correctness requirement.

The counter is feature-scoped and durable across dispatches — the same lifetime as the ledger it sits
beside — and is **not cleared by a `build_review` PASS**. It is credited back by a rebase that
invalidated the gate, under `adr-2026-08-18-rebase-invalidation-refunds-build-review-convergence` D6, which
states that rule over every lap-counting field on `KickbackGateEntry` and supersedes
`adr-2026-08-12` D2's PASS reset. The property being protected is unchanged — a feature whose
passing verdict is later invalidated must not carry stale mechanical laps toward a halt it did not
earn — but it is keyed on the invalidation that justifies it rather than on the PASS, because a PASS
also fires for every downstream kickback that re-opens `build_review`, which is why the counters it
cleared were unreachable.

Amended 2026-08-18, before implementation, on operator decision recorded in that ADR's D6.

### D5 — Exhaustion is a `needs-human` HALT, not a park (OQ-4)

`needs-human`, chosen not defaulted, for `adr-2026-08-17` D4's reason: `daemon-rekick.ts` clears and
re-dispatches `mechanical` and `unclassified` halts on every sweep, so a guard whose halt the daemon
auto-clears is not a guard — and this halt's whole purpose is to wait for a human judgement.
`adr-2026-07-28` permits only `needs-human` or `mechanical` for a new writer and requires
`needs-human` whenever retry safety is not mechanically provable, which is exactly this case.

Not a park: `adr-2026-08-06-honest-park-termination-boundary` and
`adr-2026-08-05-every-dispatch-outcome-leaves-an-operator-lever` together require a terminal state
that names its lever. The halt body renders the rubric, its closed reason, the bounded `detail`, the
allowance consumed, and the action that resolves it, per `adr-2026-08-08`.

### D6 — Reduced coverage is a distinct record kind in the existing store, never a finding acceptance

`adr-2026-08-13` §2 and §4 decided that infrastructure failures remain blocking and that `accept`
refuses them, under a narrowness rule: "One action accepts exactly one finding; there is no
rubric-wide, feature-wide, or future-finding wildcard." **That rule is preserved literally.** `accept`
keeps refusing infrastructure failures. Accepting reduced coverage is a different act on a different
object — a rubric that produced no finding at all — and it gets its own record kind and its own CLI
action in the same store, under the same lease, with the same authority gate (interactive TTY plus
machine-scoped operator identity; a piped provider subprocess cannot pass it).

Sharing the store, not the verb, is what makes this conform: `adr-2026-08-13` §3's single
feature-local transaction, §5's external-writer event path, and §6's publication renderer all
generalize to a second record kind without relaxing any finding rule.

Refusals (each leaving the store unchanged, each observable per §5): non-interactive or unidentified
operator; a rubric that is not currently in an **exhausted** mechanical-fault state — it judged, it
was skipped, or allowance remains; a stale review; and a duplicate decision for the same rubric.

**The action's callable interface (amended 2026-08-19, before implementation, on operator decision).**
The action is named and invoked exactly as:

```bash
conduct-ts build-review record-reduced-coverage --feature <slug> --lap <lap> --rubric <rubric> --rationale <text>
```

`record-reduced-coverage`, not `accept-reduced-coverage`: this decision's own rule is that the store
is shared and the verb is not, so the action does not lead with `accept` and cannot read as a variant
of finding acceptance.

Argument shape follows its sibling `build-review accept --feature <slug> --lap <lap> --finding <id>
--rationale <text>`, with `--rubric` replacing `--finding` as the selector. `--lap` is required and
carries the same exact-current-lap semantics `accept` applies — it is what makes this decision's
**stale review** refusal above reachable, and without it this would be the only state-changing
`build-review` action with no freshness pin. The closed reason is **not** an argument: D7 derives it
from engine-supplied state, so the operator names only the rubric.

This paragraph exists because `writing-system-tests` HALTed on 2026-08-19 rather than invent a
public CLI contract for the Story 10 acceptance spec — the story, plan, and this ADR all required a
distinct operator action but none named it. The grammar above is that stable callable interface;
Task 14 implements it and `docs/reference/cli.md` documents it.

### D7 — Identity is `{rubric, closed reason}` — the coarsest key that cannot evaporate (OQ-1)

The decision's identity is derived from the rubric enum and the closed result reason, both engine-
supplied. Nothing free-text enters it, satisfying `adr-2026-08-16` D1's rule that every identity
input is a closed vocabulary member or an engine-verified reference. `detail`, excerpts and timestamps
are report-only, exactly as `summary` and `evidenceLocations` are for findings.

> **Amended 2026-09-10 by #1986:** approved adr-2026-09-10-separate-custom-review-coverage-identity D2/D3 extends this rule for project-declared custom rubrics: the subject is the validated declaration and closed failure reason within the feature. No effective content digest is required for missing coverage, and package changes alone do not expire that decision. Different declarations or reasons do not match. The built-in identity, explicit operator checks, exhaustion prerequisite, distinction from finding acceptance, and no-judgments prohibition remain unchanged.

**Why not narrower.** Including the preflight sub-reason, the lap, or the snapshot digest would make
the decision evaporate as the fault's incidental particulars shift between laps — which is precisely
the failure `adr-2026-08-16` was written to fix for findings ("an operator-accepted finding stops
binding as soon as the next lap's grader re-words it"), and precisely the livelock incident 1
suffered. A decision that must be re-made every lap is not a resolution.

**The accepted cost, stated plainly.** A decision covers any later mechanical fault of the same class
on the same rubric within the feature. It cannot cover a different rubric (D6), cannot cover a
different reason class (which is what D2 exists to keep meaningful), and can never suppress a
finding (D8). D2 is therefore load-bearing for this narrowness, not a cosmetic cleanup.

### D8 — A judged finding still blocks, and the two decision kinds cannot substitute

`deriveEffectiveBuildReviewVerdict` gains exactly one relaxation: an infrastructure branch carrying a
matching reduced-coverage decision no longer contributes to the blocking set. `unresolvedFindingIds`
is untouched, so a rubric that ran and found something blocks exactly as today. A reduced-coverage
decision never resolves a finding; a finding acceptance never resolves reduced coverage. The reducer
stays pure, fails closed on unreadable state, and continues to reject a malformed aggregate outright.

> **Amended 2026-08-21 by #1763:** "blocks exactly as today" covers bound and unbound findings. A
> finding the rubric itself marks `boundTo: beyond` (outside every `Done when:` criterion of its
> task) leaves the blocking set per `adr-2026-08-21-review-bound-by-plan-done-when-criteria` D3 —
> a rubric verdict, never an operator decision; reduced coverage still suppresses no finding.

### D9 — Reduced coverage is stamped where a reader will meet it (OQ-5, no expiry)

Every lap that passes with a reduced-coverage decision in force records, on the lap evidence and via
`adr-2026-08-13` §6's existing renderer on the retained PR and the shipped record: rubric, closed
reason, current bounded `detail`, operator, rationale, and decision time. `adr-2026-08-13` §6's
fail-closed rule carries over — a known record that cannot be rendered blocks completion rather than
disappearing.

The decision does **not** expire. It is self-limiting instead: it has effect only while a fault of
that class is actually present, so a healed environment makes it inert without any expiry rule, and
the per-lap re-stamp means a reader always sees the coverage that was actually reduced on the lap
that shipped. An expiry keyed on diff change would re-introduce D7's evaporation failure.

### D10 — Occurrences ride the existing spine

Mechanical-fault laps, allowance exhaustion, and reduced-coverage acceptance/refusal are occurrences
on `ConductorEvent`; the durable counter and the store are state (event-spine exception C). The
standalone CLI writes through `adr-2026-08-13` §5's existing external same-schema writer (exceptions
A/B). No new event file, no new ledger, no sidecar. `build_review_rubric_infrastructure_failure`
already exists and is reused; additive fields follow `adr-2026-07-26-event-sink-registry-exhaustiveness`.

## Alternatives considered

- **Amend `adr-2026-08-13` so `accept` clears an exhausted mechanical fault** (the single-verb form of
  the operator's originally chosen approach). Rejected by operator direction after reading both texts:
  it reopens an operator-approved narrowness rule so one verb can act on two different objects, and
  the ergonomic gain is one command name.
- **A second counter inside `bumpKickbackGate` that mechanical faults increment instead of
  `cumulative`** (the intake's first hypothesis). Rejected: it still publishes a FAIL aggregate, so
  every downstream consumer — remediation routing, the failure-detail renderer, `rubricFailures` —
  must each learn to special-case a non-judgement. D3 removes the FAIL at its source, which is
  strictly less machinery and reuses an approved path.
- **A per-feature rubric waiver read before dispatch, degrading the rubric to `skipped`.** Genuinely
  attractive — `skipped` is already non-blocking, so the reducer would need no change, and no lap
  would be spent on a rubric known to be broken. Rejected as the whole answer because it is
  prospective only: it cannot clear the lap that is already failing, which is incident 1. Its
  pre-dispatch economy is recorded as an available follow-up on top of this decision.
- **Global `build_review.rubrics.<r>.enabled = false`** — today's only non-manual escape hatch.
  Rejected: it is repository-global, unrecorded per feature, invisible on shipped evidence, and
  silently reduces coverage on every subsequent feature until someone remembers to undo it.
- **Auto-accept after N faults, with no human in the loop.** Rejected: a recurring environmental fault
  would become a permanent silent coverage gap, and `adr-2026-08-13`'s threat boundary is precisely
  unattended harness activity.
- **Identity including the lap or snapshot digest.** Rejected — see D7; this is the evaporation
  failure `adr-2026-08-16` already ruled on for findings.

## Consequences

- **Positive.** Both #1629 incidents terminate correctly: incident 2's zero-cost faults stop charging
  the semantic cap and halt on the mechanical allowance naming the mechanical cause; incident 1
  reaches PASS after one recorded decision, with no ledger edit and no history rewrite. `preflight-failed`
  stops being a declared-but-unreachable vocabulary member. Reduced coverage becomes visible on the
  shipped record for the first time.
- **Preserved invariants.** `adr-2026-08-13`'s finding rules, narrowness rule, authority gate and
  refusal list are untouched; `accept` still refuses infrastructure failures. `adr-2026-08-17` D3's
  assumption that mechanical faults do not tick `rubricFailures` is honored by construction.
  `adr-2026-08-12`'s cap value stands; its PASS reset is superseded by `adr-2026-08-18-rebase-invalidation-refunds-build-review-convergence`. No LLM enters any decision path this ADR adds.
- **Negative / watch.** The allowance of 3 is inferred, not measured (D4) — the first feature to hit a
  genuinely transient fault four times will halt where a larger allowance would have passed; the halt
  names the cause, and the constant is one line to revisit with evidence. A reduced-coverage decision
  is class-scoped, so it can cover a second, different fault of the same class on that rubric later in
  the feature (D7's accepted cost). D2 touches the mapping every branch flows through, so a mapping
  mistake would mis-name a fault class; it is total and closed at the type level to bound that.
- **Known limitation (#497 class), accepted.** `.pipeline/` is gitignored, so deleting
  `.worktrees/<slug>` discards both the allowance counter and the decisions. This fails open — a fresh
  allowance and a re-decidable fault, never a spurious pass — identical to the limitation
  `adr-2026-07-26`, `adr-2026-08-12` and `adr-2026-08-17` each accepted.
