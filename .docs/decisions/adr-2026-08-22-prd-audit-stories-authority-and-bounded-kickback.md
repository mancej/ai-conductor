# ADR: prd_audit judges stories as authority, runs always, and owns the only bounded kickback
**Date:** 2026-08-22
**Status:** APPROVED
**Deciders:** operator (James Stoup), engineer session for jstoup111/ai-conductor#1805

## Context

`prd_audit` is skipped on the technical track (`steps.ts:228`) and most features are classified
technical, so the delivered-requirements question is usually never asked. Its kickback appends
`rem-*` tasks through `appendRemediationTasks` (`conductor.ts:2756`) with no per-feature bound.
`.docs/` is excluded from every gate surface (adr-2026-08-13-markdown-default-inversion), so no
gate can currently react to an acceptance-criteria change. Daemon-mode kickbacks to DECIDE must
halt (adr-2026-07-27-daemon-decide-kickback-halt, adr-2026-08-03-fail-closed-decide-entry).

## Options Considered

### Option A: Two gates — prd_audit on FRs plus a new stories audit
- **Cons:** re-creates the one-question-two-judges pattern this feature removes.

### Option B: Rename prd_audit to a stories audit
- **Cons:** a rename touches step names, config, `rem-prd-audit-*` ids in merged plans, telemetry,
  the eval corpus, and needs a consumer migration — for no behavior change.

### Option C: Keep the name; re-key the contract; run always; bound the kickback (chosen)

## Decision

1. **Authority.** The stories' acceptance criteria are the contract. PRD FRs (when a PRD exists) and
   the plan's stated outcome are intent context. Coverage is read through the committed coherence
   mapping where present (adr-2026-07-22-coherence-gate-placement-and-validation-split) and the plan's
   `**Stories:**` resolver (adr-2026-08-05-token-first-stories-reference-normalization).
2. **Run rule.** `prd_audit` runs on every feature, every tier, every track. `skippableForTracks`
   is removed; `configDisableAllowed` stays the only skip. The technical-track default of
   adr-2026-06-29-track-marker-location becomes inert for this step. `GATE_SURFACE.prd_audit`
   adds `.docs/stories/**` and `.docs/specs/**` as declared inputs so a criteria edit invalidates a
   prior PASS (a scoped carve-out to the markdown inversion; the partition itself is unchanged).
3. **Grades.** Each finding carries exactly one of `PASS | FIXABLE | PLAN_GAP | OVER_SCOPE`, schema-
   constrained; the engine derives the gate outcome. `FIXABLE` must name an owning plan task id and
   a story criterion id; a finding naming neither is rejected as malformed by the same parser that
   validates the verdict table, and never becomes work. The existing `ALIGNED|PARTIAL|DIVERGED|MISSING`
   per-FR table remains as evidence rows; the grade is what routes.

   > **Amended 2026-08-25 by #1848:** An `OVER_SCOPE` finding that owns no story criterion is a
   > legitimate first-class finding, not malformed: it is reported under the
   > `## Findings without an owning criterion` section with a report-scoped `NC.<n>` key (key
   > semantics and decision binding: adr-2026-08-24-over-scope-decision-block-and-durable-refusals
   > D4 as amended by #1848). The malformed-rejection rule above continues to apply to
   > `FIXABLE`/`PLAN_GAP`/`PASS` rows and to any row whose key matches neither the
   > story-criterion form nor an in-section `NC.<n>` form — but rejection is now per-row: rows
   > carrying an invalid or duplicated key are rejected individually with a named diagnostic
   > while sibling rows stay consumed (departing from adr-2026-08-13 §1's whole-result failure —
   > prd-audit rows are independently meaningful verdicts). A rejected row still blocks the gate
   > and the halt names each rejected row and why; report-level faults (missing PRD marker or
   > Verdict Table) remain whole-report mechanical faults. Findings with no owning criterion
   > still never become work — they route only to the operator decision block.
4. **Scope-as-intent.** `OVER_SCOPE` judges shipped behavior against the plan and intent (PRD
   Goals/Non-Goals and In/Out Scope, else stories + plan outcome). Within intent → self-accepted and
   recorded as a widening; outside intent, not user-visible → recorded, ships; outside intent,
   user-visible → HALT. Operator-reseal rationale justification (formerly a Scope sub-rule) is judged
   here; seal detection stays mechanical at commit.

   > **Amended 2026-08-24 by #1846:** The outside-intent, user-visible HALT now carries a fourth
   > durable disposition: an operator **refusal**, recorded per criterion (with rationale,
   > operator identity, and time) alongside accepted widenings. A refused criterion still blocks
   > the gate; the subsequent halt names it as refused — rework required — instead of re-offering
   > acceptance. A later acceptance overrides a refusal; a refusal is moot once the audit no
   > longer flags the criterion. See adr-2026-08-24-over-scope-decision-block-and-durable-refusals.
> **Amended 2026-09-07 by #2429:** Explicit refusal revision and NC relationship authority now follow adr-2026-09-07-durable-prd-widening-decision-reconciliation D1-D4/D8. An old cleared acceptance cannot override a newer refusal; an explicit revision names the prior decision. The report-local NC key remains presentation, and valid original decisions are captured before current-report reconciliation. No NC case becomes a BUILD task, and the existing FIXABLE/PLAN_GAP routing and allowances below remain unchanged.

5. **Bounded kickback.** `FIXABLE` findings route to BUILD through the existing remediation append
   seam — the only plan appender — under engine-enforced caps: **one lap per feature**, at most
   **5** added tasks and at most **25% of the authored task count**, whichever is lower; all three
   operator-configurable. Each appended task carries `Criterion:` and its parent task. Exceeding a
   cap, or a second lap, converts to a needs-human HALT listing every finding. The lap rides the
   durable per-gate kickback ledger (`gates.prd_audit`), never the build_review cumulative counter.

   > **Amended 2026-08-31 by #2119:** A `FIXABLE` finding whose remedy is owned by task ids
   > already in the active plan may instead take the non-appending `existing-task` disposition
   > (adr-2026-08-25-as-built-remediable-findings-bounded-build-route decision 9). It routes to
   > BUILD without the append seam, adds no tasks, and is bounded by the gate's lap cap alone;
   > the 5-task and 25% caps continue to govern appending dispositions only.
6. **Growth ledger.** The kickback ledger gains a per-feature `growth` record:
   `{authored, added, byGate, remaining}`; pre-existing `rem-*` tasks found in a plan at first read
   count toward `authored`. Surfaced by `conduct-ts` status output and emitted on the spine.
   (Extending the ledger was chosen over a new spine record because the ledger already owns
   per-feature kickback state and the removal guard reads appended ids from it.)

   > **Amended 2026-08-31 by #2119:** An `existing-task` disposition leaves `added` and
   > `remaining` untouched by design — a plan that did not grow records no growth.
7. **PLAN_GAP.** Happy-path criterion unmet with no owning task → HALT (class `plan-gap`); negative/
   edge criterion → recorded in the verdict and the shipped record, ships, unless configuration
   requires a halt. Never a kickback; the daemon DECIDE-halt rule is unchanged.
8. **Recorded findings** are persisted in the verdict artifact and copied into the shipped record
   in a shape #1810 can consume without re-review. Every halt carries a class and a clearable lever.

## Consequences

### Positive
- One gate answers "built as expected", on every feature; growth is bounded and visible.

### Negative
- Every feature now pays a prd_audit dispatch at SHIP, including S-tier refactors (empty criteria → fast PASS).
- The validation group's single `planRemediation` dispatch now receives graded input; the try-1
  short-circuit classifier must map the new grades.

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Remove `skippableForTracks`; extend `GATE_SURFACE.prd_audit`.
- [ ] Grade schema + parser rejection; cap enforcement around `appendRemediationTasks`; growth record.
- [ ] Verdict/shipped-record recorded-findings shape.
