## HALT

```text
Need user decision: current HEAD already silently delays and retries an absent initial owner read (d6337d883), so Task 1's required RED cannot be established and the sealed plan must be amended or superseded before BUILD continues.


remediation produced no valid dispositions (check .pipeline/remediation.json: malformed JSON, stale file, or all dispositions dropped by validation)
```
