## HALT

```text
rebase conflict — parked for human resolution
replay commit c0e8f1c3b (replayed as fb10383f5) 'feat: wire built-in group lifecycle'; rebase completed all 52 commits but src/conductor/test/engine/conductor-telemetry-parity.test.ts:821 now fails ('expected done to be failed') against src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts no-verdict validation-group halt path (~lines 8204-8248); source intends a group no-verdict halt to write the group entry member 'failed' ([step.name]: 'failed'); upstream #2466 intends only the no-verdict member 'failed' with satisfied siblings atomically retained 'done' so a cleared HALT re-dispatches just the failed member; missing decision: whether the feature adopts upstream's per-member retention semantics (and its test assertion is updated to expect entry 'done' / no-verdict member 'failed') or the group-entry 'failed' write must be preserved
Conflicted files: src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts

Resume procedure:
  1. Resolve the conflicts in the listed file(s).
  2. git rebase --continue
  3. rm .pipeline/HALT
  4. Re-queue the feature for the daemon.
