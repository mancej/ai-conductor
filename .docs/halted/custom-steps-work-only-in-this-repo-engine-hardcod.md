## HALT

```text
Validation group "prd_audit" halted: needs human DECIDE — AB-2 (architectural-clarity: adr-2026-09-11-github-operation-ownership D1 requires a typed guarded GitHub boundary that does not exist on origin/main (no guarded operation interface in src/conductor/src; the owning feature enforce-ownership-across-all-harness-github-operat has no .docs/shipped record), and origin/main's conductor.ts:6630 already issued the same raw this.gh pr edit that release-metadata-flow.ts:62/:95/:107 now carry unchanged per plan Task 12 Step 3; no task in this plan (Tasks 11-13 examined) admits building that boundary, so a human must decide between ordering this feature behind enforce-ownership or approving a superseding/scoped ADR amendment that accepts the behavior-preserving move — the as-built review itself names exactly those two options.); AB-3 (architectural-clarity: adr-2026-09-11-github-operation-ownership D7's bounded operation inventory and production-boundary audit do not exist anywhere in the source tree, so there is nothing for release-metadata-flow.ts's sites to be added to; plan Task 12 (.docs/plans/custom-steps-work-only-in-this-repo-engine-hardcod.md:309) assumed the inventory already existed, and creating it is the enforce-ownership feature's scope, not an admitted task here — same dependency/ordering-or-superseding-ADR decision as AB-2.)
