## HALT

```text
Validation group "prd_audit" halted: as-built review verdict is BLOCKED — shipped code violates an approved architecture decision

Blocking findings:
AB-1 (REMEDIABLE; adr-2026-08-26-music-vocabulary-player-composer-rename Decision 3): `bin/install` still executes `conduct-ts`, so the deprecated alias is not operator-facing only.
AB-2 (DESIGN; Sealed Story 4 negative path): The plan has no repo-relative canonical-launcher design for pre-reinstall harness, hook, daemon, and brain calls.
```
