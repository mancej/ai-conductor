Validation group "prd_audit" halted: needs human DECIDE — AB-1 (existing-task: src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:4760-4765 hashes only planPath, hintSource.source, the evidence [gate, evidenceFile] pairs and the sorted task bindings — all stable across laps for the same finding — so a genuinely later repair of the same finding reuses the prior key, src/conductor/src/engine/repair-obligations.ts:172-180 returns the earlier record as replayed:true, and conductor.ts:4779-4797 never persists the fresh baseline.head/tree captured at conductor.ts:4766-4769; the as-built Plan-Gap check found no PLAN_GAP because Task 3 Done-when 1 ('a new open obligation for a distinct later repair') and Task 9 Done-when 2 ('dispatches a distinct later repair as new work') already require this behaviour, so it is implementation divergence bound to existing plan work, not a planning omission. Sibling sweep: conductor.ts:4756-4765 is the only production admission-key construction (grep 'admissionKey' over src/ returns only this site and the store's own plumbing), and the obligation id at conductor.ts:4771 is derived from that same key, so key and id stay single-sourced and cannot drift; conductor.ts:4650 'admissionKeys' is the unrelated plan-task-reference diagnostic and is deliberately excluded. No existing assertion is removed: the same-effect crash-replay coverage at test/engine/repair-obligations.test.ts:74-78 and the restart-replay cases Task 9 Done-when 1 delivered must both still pass, and the later-repair case is added alongside them. Confidence 99% — verified by direct read of the key construction, the replay branch, and the caller sweep.); AB-2 (existing-task: RepairObligationStore.admit is declared at src/conductor/src/engine/repair-obligations.ts:67 and returned at :213 but a sweep of all production TypeScript under src/conductor/src finds no caller — the only live path is admitOrReplay at src/conductor/src/engine/conductor.ts:4779 — so it is an unreachable rung under the enabled reachability check; Task 3 owns repair-obligations.ts and its Done-when 1-3 are all expressible through the keyed admission path, so removing the raw surface is existing plan work rather than a new plan task. Matched pair: the interface member at :67 and the object-literal member at :213 are the same enumeration and must be edited together; the private admit(admission, admissionKey?) helper at :159 stays as the single implementation so no second admission path is created. This removal is not a coverage regression — every current caller is a test (test/engine/repair-obligations.test.ts:50,52,63,92,103,121,123,128; test/engine/task-progress.test.ts:364,394,414; test/engine/task-cli.test.ts:533,752; test/acceptance/plan-growth-existing-task-restage.acceptance.test.ts:677) and each is migrated to admitOrReplay with a distinct key per intended admission and a repeated key where the case asserts replay, so the Task 3 Done-when 1-3 replay/distinct/plan-isolation assertions and the Task 4/6/8 fixtures they seed are preserved verbatim in intent. Sweep for what the removal orphans: nothing else references admit, and RepairAdmission/RepairAdmissionResult stay in use by admitOrReplay. Confidence 99% — verified by definition read and full caller sweep.) — remediation produced no dispatchable build work; the implicated task(s) are already evidence-complete — human needed
