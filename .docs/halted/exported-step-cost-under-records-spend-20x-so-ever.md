## HALT

```text
Validation group "prd_audit" halted: as-built review verdict is BLOCKED — shipped code violates an approved architecture decision

Blocking findings:
AB-1 (REMEDIABLE; Task 8): `renderer_error` is daemon-reachable but has no interactive production subscriber, contradicting the sealed terminal-visibility outcome and the feature diagram.
AB-2 (REMEDIABLE; adr-014-otel-observability-exporter decision 4): Snapshot handling loops over every cost and token bucket on the awaited bus instead of doing O(1) handler work.
AB-3 (DESIGN; —): The sealed missing-ledger outcome is impossible under the approved after-terminal-delivery design because production persistence creates the ledger before the snapshot read.
```
