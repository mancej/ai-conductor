## HALT

```text
Validation group "prd_audit" halted: as-built review verdict is BLOCKED and needs a human decision — DESIGN finding(s): AB-2 (Story 1 acceptance criterion)

Blocking findings:
AB-1 (REMEDIABLE; Task 1): The classifier treats any matching token after `git` as the subcommand, so a non-commit command such as `git branch commit` reaches derive feedback.
AB-2 (DESIGN; Story 1 acceptance criterion): The approved closed classifier omits `git pull`, although pull can create the fresh merge commit that Story 1 requires the hook to evaluate.
```
