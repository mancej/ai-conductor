## HALT

```text
Plan gap: `src/conductor/src/engine/test-suite-cli.ts` calls `FullSuiteVerifier.ensure()` without retaining and recording a `PRESERVED_WITHIN_BUDGET` inspection. ADR 2026-08-28 decision 4 requires every caller that acts on preservation to record it once. The appended remediation tasks cover the dispatched gate, completion recheck, and rebase pre-verifiers, but not this CLI path. Route through remediation to append an in-scope task with a CLI regression test; do not patch outside the approved plan.


build_stall remediation requested 1 plan task with no plan-growth allowance; only validated prd_audit FIXABLE or as-built REMEDIABLE findings may append remediation work.
