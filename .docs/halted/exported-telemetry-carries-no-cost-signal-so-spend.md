## HALT

```text
Validation group "prd_audit" halted: as-built review verdict is BLOCKED — shipped code violates an approved architecture decision

Blocking findings:
AB-1 (DESIGN; adr-014-otel-observability-exporter #1938 amendment): The new cost and dispatch metric points ship without the approved project/feature identity seam, whose ownership is assigned to concurrent feature #1938 rather than this feature's plan.
```
