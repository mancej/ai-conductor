# Stories: Engine-stamped run identity for SHIP-tail verdict artifacts (#1838)

Track: technical. Design authority: adr-2026-08-25-engine-stamped-ship-tail-verdict-run-identity (D1–D9).
Gates in scope: prd_audit, architecture_review_as_built, manual_test. build_review and custom-step markers out of scope.

## Story 1: Engine stamps run identity at the dispatch settle boundary

As the conductor, I want each SHIP-tail verdict dispatch's run identity recorded beside the existing code stamp so that every reader can tell this lap's verdict from an earlier one.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a prd_audit dispatch settles after writing its report, when the engine records the settle, then the gate-code-validity sidecar carries the dispatch's attempt id as the run identity beside `codeStamp`
- Given the three verdict gates run concurrently in a validation group, when each branch settles, then its stamp is written on that branch's own settle path before the join reads any verdict

#### Negative Paths
- Given the provider's output text embeds a run-identity value, when the engine stamps the sidecar, then the provider-supplied value is ignored and the engine's own attempt id is recorded (never validated as an echo)
- Given the sidecar cannot be written (e.g. `.pipeline/` unwritable), when the settle records it, then the failure is reported loudly for that branch and the engine does not throw or silently mark the verdict identity-stamped
- Given two validation-group branches settle near-simultaneously, when both stamp their own sidecars, then neither branch's stamp overwrites or blocks the other's (each gate has its own sidecar file)

### Done When
- [ ] After a verdict-gate dispatch settles, the gate's sidecar file contains both `codeStamp` and the run-identity field equal to that dispatch's attempt id
- [ ] A unit test proves the stamp is engine-authored: a doctored provider output carrying a bogus identity leaves the sidecar with the engine's value
- [ ] A validation-group test proves each branch's stamp exists before the group join evaluates verdicts

## Story 2: Post-dispatch write handshake makes a non-writing audit fail visibly

As the conductor, I want to verify immediately after a verdict dispatch settles that the gate's declared outputs were produced by this dispatch so that a silently non-writing audit is a visible step failure, not a success.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a prd_audit dispatch writes `.pipeline/prd-audit.md` during its run, when the handshake runs after settle, then the attempt is eligible for completion checking with no handshake finding
- Given an architecture_review_as_built dispatch settles, when the handshake runs, then its evidence is that this dispatch's structured result was validated and persisted as the typed verdict stamped with this dispatch's attempt id, and no file written by the provider counts as evidence
- Given any terminal dispatch outcome (success, error, halt), when the step concludes, then the handshake observation is recorded — not only on the success path

#### Negative Paths
- Given a dispatch settles ✓ but wrote neither report nor marker, when the handshake runs, then the attempt is scored failed with a reason naming each missing artifact, the expected run identity, and the found identity/mtime of whatever is on disk
- Given a dispatch settles ✓ but only the report (not the marker) was rewritten, when the handshake runs, then the reason names specifically the artifact that was not produced
- Given the handshake's own read throws (unreadable file, corrupt sidecar), when it evaluates, then the attempt is treated as not-verified (fail-closed for the verdict) while the engine itself does not crash
- Given an architecture_review_as_built dispatch whose structured result is missing or rejected, when the handshake runs, then it records the rejection outcome, no typed verdict is persisted for that attempt, and the attempt is scored absent

### Done When
- [ ] Replaying the 2026-08-23 shape (settle ✓, artifacts untouched from a prior lap) yields a failed attempt whose reason names `.pipeline/prd-audit.md`, the expected attempt id, and the stale identity/mtime — and never quotes the stale report's findings
- [ ] The handshake path is exercised for all three gates in tests, serial and validation-group
- [ ] Handshake evaluation never throws out of the step loop (corrupt-input test)

## Story 3: All readers judge identity, not just the completion predicate

As the routing/halt machinery, I want every reader of a SHIP-tail verdict artifact to consult one shared identity check so that no reader can act on a prior lap's findings.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a report stamped with the current dispatch's identity and blocking rows, when `classifyPrdAuditGaps` runs, then those rows drive routing as today
- Given a report stamped with the current identity and no blocking rows, when the completion predicate runs, then the gate passes as today

#### Negative Paths
- Given a report whose stamp identifies an earlier lap of the same session, when `classifyPrdAuditGaps` runs, then it returns no blocking rows from that report and the caller treats the state as "no fresh verdict" — the stale rows never reach a kickback hint or halt reason
- Given a stale-identity report, when the completion predicate scores the step, then the reason states the verdict was not produced by this run and names the artifact, expected identity, and found identity — with none of the stale findings quoted as current
- Given the gate-code-validity preserve path (#817) holds a PASS sidecar while the on-disk report is from an older lap with blocking rows, when the predicate evaluates, then the stale report is not re-read as a current clean/blocking verdict

### Done When
- [ ] `classifyPrdAuditGaps` (and the halt writers it feeds) take the shared identity input; a regression test with a same-session earlier-lap report produces zero blocking classifications
- [ ] The stale-artifact sweep remains gated on the same shared helper (#817 D4) — a test proves the sweep and the readers agree on the same artifact
- [ ] grep of the diff shows no reader retains a private session-only mtime freshness check for the three gates

## Story 4: Identity mismatch reruns within budget, then halts self-describingly

As the retry classifier, I want a missing/prior-identity verdict scored as "absent" so that the judge reruns within the existing budget and exhaustion produces a halt an operator can act on.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given the handshake scored "no verdict for this run", when `classifyRetryDecision` runs, then the decision is rerun (routeClass absent), not route
- Given a rerun then writes a correctly-stamped verdict, when the completion predicate runs, then the lap proceeds normally

#### Negative Paths
- Given the retry budget is exhausted with the verdict still missing/mismatched, when the step concludes, then a `needs-human` halt is written through `writeHaltMarker` whose reason names the step, the artifact, the expected run identity, and the found identity/mtime — and quotes no stale findings
- Given the mismatch, when the decision is made, then it is made on a typed facet — a test that rewords the reason text does not change the routing outcome
- Given a fresh adverse (blocking) verdict with a matching stamp, when classification runs, then it still routes (named-route) — identity checking does not convert genuine failures into endless reruns

### Done When
- [ ] Classifier unit tests cover: mismatch⇒rerun, matching-adverse⇒route, exhaustion⇒needs-human halt with artifact+both-identities in the reason
- [ ] The halt rides the existing seam so the committed halt record carries the same detail
- [ ] No new retry budget, config key, or event member is introduced (diff inspection)

## Story 5: Recovery is clear-and-rerun — no hand-deletion

As an operator, I want clearing the halt to be sufficient so that recovery does not require knowing which `.pipeline/` files to delete.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a stale-identity halt was cleared (HALT + HALT.class removed), when the daemon re-dispatches the feature, then the re-run treats prior-identity artifacts as absent input and a fresh audit runs

#### Negative Paths
- Given the prior lap's stale report and marker are still on disk after halt-clear, when the re-dispatched gate evaluates before the fresh audit writes, then the stale pair does not reproduce the halt (the failure mode where clearing alone re-halted is gone)
- Given the fresh audit then writes a stamped blocking verdict, when the gate evaluates, then the blocking verdict is honored — recovery does not whitewash genuine findings

### Done When
- [ ] An integration test reproduces #1838's recovery: stale artifacts present, halt cleared, re-dispatch succeeds without any manual `.pipeline/` deletion
- [ ] A companion test proves a fresh stamped blocking verdict after recovery is still honored (no whitewash)

## Story 6: Unstamped artifacts fall back to mtime; kill-switch reverts cleanly

As the engine, I want legacy prd_audit and manual_test artifacts and disabled deployments to behave exactly as today, and the as-built gate to accept only its identity-stamped typed verdict, so that the contract rolls out and reverts safely.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a prd_audit or manual_test verdict artifact with no run-identity stamp (written pre-upgrade), when readers evaluate it, then today's mtime-floor behavior applies unchanged
- Given the existing gate-code-validity kill-switch is off, when the prd_audit and manual_test gates run, then identity checking is bypassed and pure mtime behavior applies end-to-end
- Given the existing gate-code-validity kill-switch is off, when the architecture_review_as_built gate runs, then identity checking stays in force: freshness is the typed verdict's attempt id and no mtime comparison decides it

#### Negative Paths
- Given an unstamped stale artifact, when readers evaluate it, then it is not treated as MORE trusted than today (fallback never widens acceptance)
- Given a corrupt/unparseable prd_audit or manual_test sidecar, when the identity helper reads it, then it degrades to the unstamped path without throwing
- Given an unstamped or Markdown-only as-built artifact, even one whose mtime is newer than the dispatch start, when readers evaluate it, then it is scored absent and the step reruns — the as-built gate has no mtime fallback

### Done When
- [ ] Fallback tests: for prd_audit and manual_test, unstamped-fresh passes and unstamped-stale fails, identical to pre-change behavior; an unstamped or Markdown-only as-built artifact scores absent
- [ ] Kill-switch test: with the flag off, no identity comparison occurs for prd_audit and manual_test and existing suites pass unchanged, while the as-built gate still judges its typed verdict by run identity

## Story 7: manual_test composes with its whitewash machinery

As the manual_test gate, I want run identity added without weakening the #367 guards so that anti-whitewash behavior is preserved.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a manual-test run appends its `## Attempt N` section and the engine stamps the run identity, when the gate evaluates, then the latest attempt section is judged exactly as today plus the identity check

#### Negative Paths
- Given results flip FAIL→PASS with HEAD unmoved, when the gate evaluates, then the whitewash guard still blocks regardless of a matching run-identity stamp
- Given the results file was not appended this dispatch (prior lap's latest section only), when the gate evaluates, then the identity check scores "no fresh verdict" instead of re-judging the old section

### Done When
- [ ] Existing #367 whitewash tests pass unchanged with identity stamping enabled
- [ ] A stale-section test proves the prior lap's attempt section is never re-judged as current
