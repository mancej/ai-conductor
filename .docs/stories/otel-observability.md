# Stories: OpenTelemetry Observability — Phase 1

Source PRD: `.docs/specs/2026-06-28-otel-observability.md` (FR-1 … FR-10).
Phase 2 (build-task spans, FR-11–13) and Phase 3 (subagent spans, FR-14–16) are out of scope —
separate conduct passes.

Internal/non-endpoint feature (no HTTP, no auth, no DB). Negative paths focus on dependency
unavailability, timeouts, resource exhaustion, partial failure, concurrency, and malformed config.

## Story: Exporter is an additive, opt-out listener

**Requirement:** FR-1

As a harness maintainer, I want the OTel exporter to attach as a pure event-bus listener that is
off by default, so that observability can never alter or destabilize a conductor run.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given no `otel:` block in `.ai-conductor/config.yml`, when a conductor run executes, then no
  exporter is constructed, no span/metric is produced, and no OTel network or file activity occurs.
- Given the exporter is enabled, when it subscribes to the bus, then it registers only `.on(...)`
  listeners and modifies no existing emission site (verified by the emit call sites being
  unchanged from baseline).

#### Negative Paths
- Given the exporter is disabled, when a full run emits the same event sequence as a baseline run,
  then `.pipeline/events.jsonl` and `conduct --report` output are byte-for-byte identical to a run
  built without this feature (no observable behavioral delta).
- Given the exporter constructor throws (e.g., bad SDK init), when the conductor starts, then the
  error is caught, a single warning is surfaced, and the run proceeds with the exporter disabled
  (a broken exporter never aborts startup).

### Done When
- [ ] A regression test runs a fixture conductor session with `otel` absent and asserts identical
      `events.jsonl` bytes vs. a baseline recording.
- [ ] A grep/assert confirms no `ConductorEvent` emission site was modified (exporter only calls
      `emitter.on`).
- [ ] Default config (no `otel` key) constructs no exporter — asserted by a constructor spy.

## Story: One trace per run via a root run span

**Requirement:** FR-2

As a harness operator, I want every run wrapped in a single root span, so that all step spans for
that run group into one trace I can open as a waterfall.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given the exporter is enabled, when the first `ConductorEvent` of a run arrives, then a root run
  span is opened.
- Given a run completes, when `feature_complete` is emitted, then the run span is closed with OK
  status and every step span produced during the run is a child of it (shared trace id).

#### Negative Paths
- Given a run that ends without a `feature_complete` event (process exit), when the exporter
  flushes, then the still-open run span is closed (status set per FR-9) rather than dropped.
- Given two events arrive before any run span exists due to a race, when the exporter processes
  them, then exactly one run span is created (no duplicate root spans for a single run).

### Done When
- [ ] Decoded trace from a fixture run shows exactly one root span with no parent.
- [ ] All step spans in that run share the root span's trace id and reference it as parent.
- [ ] A run terminated before `feature_complete` still yields a closed root span on flush.

## Story: Per-step spans with accurate duration and status

**Requirement:** FR-3

As a harness operator, I want each SDLC step to become a span timed from start to completion, so
that "how long does each step take" is answered directly by span duration.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a `step_started{step,index}`, when received, then a step span named for the step opens.
- Given the matching `step_completed{status: done}`, when received, then the span closes with OK
  status and a duration equal to the wall-clock between the two events (± timer resolution).
- Given a `step_failed`, when received, then the open step span closes with ERROR status.

#### Negative Paths
- Given a `step_completed` arrives with no preceding `step_started` (malformed stream), when
  processed, then the exporter emits no orphan span and logs one structured warning (no crash).
- Given a step is re-run (stale → re-dispatch emits a second `step_started` for the same step),
  when processed, then a distinct new span is opened (re-runs are separate spans, not reused).
- Given a `step_started` is never followed by completion/failure, when the run flushes, then that
  span is closed incomplete per FR-9 (never left dangling).

### Done When
- [ ] Fixture trace shows one span per executed step with name == step name and index attribute.
- [ ] A step's span duration matches the start→complete delta within timer tolerance.
- [ ] `step_failed` produces an ERROR-status span; `step_completed{done}` produces OK.
- [ ] An orphan `step_completed` produces a warning and zero spans.

## Story: Step spans carry attributes and bus events

**Requirement:** FR-4

As a harness operator, I want step spans annotated with step metadata and in-step events, so that I
can see retries, gate verdicts, and kickbacks inside the step's span without leaving the trace.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a step span is open, when it closes, then it carries `conductor.step`,
  `conductor.step.index`, `conductor.step.status`, `conductor.complexity_tier` (when known), and
  `conductor.retry.count` (from `step_failed.retryCount`/`step_retry`).
- Given a `gate_verdict`, `kickback`, or `step_retry` event for the active step, when received,
  then it is recorded as a span event on the currently-open step span with its key fields.

#### Negative Paths
- Given a `gate_verdict`/`kickback` arrives while no step span is open (between steps), when
  processed, then it is attached to the run span (or dropped with a warning) — never crashes and
  never attaches to the wrong step.
- Given `complexity_tier` is unknown at the time a span closes, when attributes are set, then the
  `conductor.complexity_tier` attribute is omitted (not set to `"undefined"`/null).

### Done When
- [ ] A step span in a fixture trace shows all required `conductor.*` attributes with correct values.
- [ ] A `step_retry` during a step appears as a span event with attempt/maxAttempts/reason.
- [ ] An out-of-band `gate_verdict` does not crash the exporter and is not mis-attributed.

## Story: Metrics for duration and retries

**Requirement:** FR-5

As a harness operator, I want duration/retry metrics emitted per step, so that I can build
cross-run dashboards of slow and retry-heavy steps in Prometheus/Grafana.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a step completes, when its span closes, then `conductor.step.duration` (histogram, ms,
  attribute `step`) records the duration.
- Given a step had retries, when it completes, then `conductor.step.retries` (counter, attribute
  `step`) is incremented by the retry count.

#### Negative Paths
- Given a step completed with zero retries, when its span closes, then no `conductor.step.retries`
  data point is recorded for that step (no zero-filled points).

### Done When
- [ ] Fixture run exports a `conductor.step.duration` histogram with one observation per step.
- [ ] A step with N retries yields a `conductor.step.retries` counter of N.
- [ ] A step with zero retries yields no `conductor.step.retries` point (asserted).

## Story: Run correlation via resource attributes

**Requirement:** FR-6

As a harness operator, I want every span and metric tagged with run/feature identity, so that I can
filter one run's trace and one feature's metrics even though bus events carry no run id.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given the exporter starts a run, when it builds its OTel Resource, then it sets `service.name`
  (e.g. `ai-conductor`), `conductor.run.id`, `conductor.feature`, and `conductor.project`.
- Given `.pipeline/conduct-session-id` (or `feature_complete.featureDesc`) is available, when the
  run id/feature are resolved, then those sourced values are used.

#### Negative Paths
- Given no session-id file and no feature desc are available at run start, when the Resource is
  built, then a generated `conductor.run.id` is used (never empty/missing) and `conductor.feature`
  falls back to a documented placeholder (e.g. `unknown`), not null.
- Given two concurrent runs in two worktrees, when both export, then each carries a distinct
  `conductor.run.id` (no collision causing two runs to merge into one trace).

### Done When
- [ ] Every exported span/metric in a fixture carries the four resource attributes, all non-empty.
- [ ] With a session-id file present, `conductor.run.id` equals the sourced value.
- [ ] With no source available, a generated non-empty run id is used and feature defaults safely.
- [ ] Two simulated concurrent runs produce two distinct run ids.

## Story: Config-selected transport (OTLP or file)

**Requirement:** FR-7

As a harness operator, I want to choose between pushing OTLP to an endpoint or writing OTel output
to a file via config, so that I can drive a live collector or hand a file to an offline tool.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given `otel: { exporter: otlp, endpoint: <url> }`, when a run executes, then spans and metrics are
  pushed to `<url>` (OTLP/HTTP by default; gRPC supported when configured).
- Given `otel: { exporter: file, file: <path> }` (default `.pipeline/otel.jsonl`), when a run
  executes, then OTLP-encoded output is written to `<path>`.
- Given `otel:` is absent or empty, when a run executes, then the exporter is disabled (default off).

#### Negative Paths
- Given `exporter: otlp` with no `endpoint`, when the exporter initializes, then it logs one clear
  config error and disables itself (does not crash, does not silently pick a wrong default host).
- Given `exporter: <unknown-value>`, when parsed, then the exporter rejects the value with a named
  error listing valid options and disables itself.
- Given `exporter: file` with no `file`, when initialized, then it uses the documented default path
  `.pipeline/otel.jsonl` (not an undefined path).

### Done When
- [ ] `exporter: file` writes a non-empty OTLP-decodable file at the configured/default path.
- [ ] `exporter: otlp` sends to an in-test collector that receives the spans/metrics.
- [ ] Absent `otel` disables export (covered with FR-1's no-op test).
- [ ] Invalid/`otlp`-without-endpoint configs log a named error and disable, never throw.

## Story: Exporter failures never break the run

**Requirement:** FR-8

As a harness operator, I want a dead collector or unwritable file to be a warning, not a failure, so
that turning on observability can never make a build fail or hang.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given `exporter: otlp` and a reachable collector, when a run executes, then export succeeds with
  no warnings.

#### Negative Paths
- Given the OTLP endpoint is unreachable/refuses connection, when the exporter attempts to push,
  then the run completes normally and exactly one structured warning (renderer_error-class) is
  surfaced — no throw propagates to the conductor.
- Given the OTLP endpoint accepts the connection but never responds, when export is attempted, then
  the export call abandons within a bounded timeout and the run is not slowed beyond that bound (no
  indefinite hang on the bus hot path).
- Given `exporter: file` and an unwritable path (permission denied / parent missing and uncreatable
  / disk full), when the exporter writes, then the failure is caught, one warning surfaces, and the
  run continues.
- Given repeated export failures across a run, when they occur, then warnings are bounded (not one
  per event flooding the log).

### Done When
- [ ] A run against a refused OTLP port finishes successfully with exactly one warning.
- [ ] A non-responding endpoint causes export to abandon within the configured timeout; total run
      delay attributable to export is ≤ that bound (asserted with a stub).
- [ ] An unwritable file path yields a warning and a completed run (no thrown EventPersist-style error).
- [ ] Export work never runs synchronously on the emit hot path (batched/async — asserted).

## Story: Incomplete spans are closed, not dropped

**Requirement:** FR-9

As a harness operator, I want spans left open at run end to be force-closed and marked incomplete,
so that an interrupted run still produces a readable (if truncated) trace.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a run ends with all step spans already closed, when flush runs, then no extra closing occurs
  and no span is marked incomplete.

#### Negative Paths
- Given a step span is still open at run end (process interrupted, `step_completed` never arrived),
  when the exporter flushes, then that span is closed with ERROR status and `conductor.incomplete =
  true`, and it still appears in the exported trace (never silently dropped).
- Given multiple nested/sibling spans are open at interruption, when flush runs, then all open spans
  are closed (innermost-first) with the incomplete marker — none are leaked.

### Done When
- [ ] A simulated mid-step interruption yields a closed span with `conductor.incomplete = true` and
      ERROR status in the exported output.
- [ ] After flush, the exporter reports zero still-open spans.
- [ ] The run span itself is closed even when a child step span was open at interruption.

## Story: Flush pending telemetry on exit

**Requirement:** FR-10

As a harness operator, I want the last run's telemetry flushed on normal and signal-driven exit, so
that the most interesting run (the one that just crashed) is not the one whose data is lost.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Happy Path
- Given a run ends normally, when the exporter shuts down, then all pending spans and metric points
  are flushed to the transport within a bounded timeout before the process exits.

#### Negative Paths
- Given the process receives SIGINT or SIGTERM mid-run, when the signal handler runs, then the
  exporter flushes pending telemetry within the bounded timeout, then exit proceeds (flush does not
  block exit indefinitely).
- Given the transport is unreachable at flush time, when flush is attempted, then flush abandons
  within the timeout (per FR-8) and exit still proceeds — a dead collector cannot wedge shutdown.
- Given flush is already in progress and a second exit signal arrives, when handled, then flush is
  not started twice and exit is not deadlocked.

### Done When
- [ ] A normal run flushes all buffered spans/metrics before exit (in-memory exporter shows none
      pending afterward).
- [ ] A SIGINT/SIGTERM simulation triggers a bounded flush then exit.
- [ ] Flush against a dead transport still returns within the timeout and allows exit.
