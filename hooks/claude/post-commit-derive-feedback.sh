# Fast-feedback derive on commit: warns on non-evidencing commits.
# Advisory only; never blocks commits or writes task-status.
#
# Invokes the ENGINE derive path (`ai-conductor derive-feedback --sha <sha>`)
# instead of a bare bash regex, so fast feedback agrees with the same
# engine-owned evidence grammar the build gate uses (H9: task ids are
# [A-Za-z0-9._-]+, not numeric-only — `rem-fr10-1` is a valid id and must
# not warn).
#
# If the engine binary is missing, broken, or errors for any reason, this
# hook falls back to a lightweight bash-only check covering the same two
# forms the engine checks: a `Task: <id>` trailer (H9 grammar), and a
# path-fallback (does the commit touch a file path referenced under a
# `### Task <id>` header in a plan file?).
#
# Advisory output (the "warning: ..." lines) is written to STDOUT — this is
# fast feedback for a human at the terminal, not a hard error the shell
# should treat as diagnostic noise. Anomalies about the engine path itself
# (unavailable/broken) go to stderr, since those are operational notices,
# not part of the Task-trailer feedback contract.
#
# Acceptance criteria:
# 1. Commit with no Task: trailer and no path-fallback match → warn (stdout) with commit sha + expected form
# 2. Evidencing commit (valid Task: trailer, ANY H9 id — numeric or not) → no stdout output
# 3. Engine binary missing / derive throws → exit 0, commit unaffected, anomaly logged (stderr)
# 4. Never writes task-status itself
# 5. Always exits 0 (non-fatal)
