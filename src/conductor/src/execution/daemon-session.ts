/**
 * Deterministic daemon-session boundary enforcement for the ai-conductor CLI.
 *
 * LLM maker sessions dispatched by the engine (daemon builds, reviews,
 * interactive-conductor steps, self-host candidates) have attempted to run
 * `ai-conductor` themselves from inside their session — recursively invoking
 * daemon subcommands (park/unpark/restart), reseal, and other state-mutating
 * conductor operations that belong exclusively to the engine that dispatched
 * them. Per the repo's design principle — machinery over prompt discipline —
 * this module makes that impossible at two seams no call path can bypass:
 *
 *  1. **Marker injection.** Every provider child session the engine spawns
 *     (both providers, invoke and interactive paths, self-host included)
 *     carries `CONDUCT_DAEMON_SESSION=1` in its environment via
 *     {@link withDaemonSessionMarker}, applied inside the provider adapters'
 *     env builders — the same adapter boundary that enforces fresh sessions
 *     (see fresh-session.ts).
 *
 *  2. **Entry guard.** The ai-conductor entry point calls
 *     {@link guardDaemonSessionInvocation} before any subcommand parsing and
 *     refuses to run when the marker is present, except for the small
 *     session-sanctioned worker-command set below that the harness's own
 *     skills and hooks REQUIRE maker sessions to run.
 *
 * There is deliberately no config off-switch. The only bypass is the
 * test-only env valve `CONDUCT_DAEMON_SESSION_UNSAFE_ALLOW=1`, mirroring the
 * fresh-session valve: nothing in production sets it, and no config key maps
 * to it. A structural test pins the valve name to this module and tests.
