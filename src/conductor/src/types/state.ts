 *                      the project itself. Nothing to assess. Conductor skips
 *                      `assess` for this mode.
 * - `fresh`          — project code exists but no harness artifacts were
 *                      present. Assess runs normally.
 * - `partial`        — harness artifacts partially present (interrupted
 *                      bootstrap). Assess runs.
 * - `re-bootstrap`   — harness fully installed; bootstrap is refreshing
 *                      detection only. Assess runs.
