 * Comprehensive orchestrator for auto-resolving open PR conflicts.

 * Composes all primitives (worktree isolation, Tier1/Tier2 resolution, acceptance
 * guards, suite gate, lease-protected push) into a single end-to-end pipeline.
 * Deterministic + assistant-resolved conflicts both flow through the same path.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Create isolated worktree at the feature branch tip (withResolveWorktree)
 *   2. Determine the base to rebase onto (resolveBase, auto-discovers origin/main)
 *   3. Capture pre-rebase feature commit subjects (for work-preservation guards)
 *   4. Start the rebase; clean rebases skip resolution, not verification or publication
 *   5. Run Tier1 (deterministic .docs/ resolution)
 *   6. If conflicts remain, run Tier2 (bounded assistant dispatch via resolver)
 *   7. Run acceptance guards (rebase state, branch current, commits preserved)
 *   8. Run suite gate (full suite must pass before pushing)
 *   9. Publish with lease (--force-with-lease) or escalate on any stage failure
 *
 * Deps (injected for testability):
 *   - runGh     Callable that executes `gh` commands (labels, comments)
 *   - runSuite  Callable that runs the user's test suite command
 *   - resolver  Tier2 resolver dispatched for remaining conflicts (RebaseResolver)
 *   - log       Callback for logging outcome lines (one log per stage result)
 *
 * @returns {kind: 'refreshed'} if published successfully,
 *          {kind: 'escalated'} if any stage fails or suite fails.
