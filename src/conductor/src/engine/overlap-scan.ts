// overlap-scan.ts — DECIDE-time unmerged-overlap scan (#523, Scope A).

// SCAFFOLD ONLY (pre-implementation): types + signatures so the acceptance and

// Every function throws — `/pipeline` (Tasks 1-6) replaces each throw with the
// real implementation, one task at a time, per the plan's TDD cycle.
