// ── Restart-intent marker (Task 5, daemon auto-restart feature) ───────────────
//
// Pure, injected helpers for the restart-intent marker schema. When the daemon
// detects a stale engine, it writes a RESTART_PENDING marker with structured
// metadata (reason, fromIdentity, targetIdentity, at) and polls for clearance
// before spawning a new engine. The marker tracks why the restart was issued
// and identifies the actors involved (daemon → engine).
//
// Round-trip guarantees: all fields (including null identities) are preserved
// exactly through write → JSON → read, so downstream logic can rely on
// structured data without parsing strings. Never throws on read/write/clear;
// failures are logged (if a logger is provided) and degraded gracefully.
