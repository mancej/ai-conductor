/**
 * Worktree-prepare module — owns **both** sides of the project-script boundary,
 * not preparation alone.
 *
 * A consumer project may supply two conventional entrypoints, and this module
 * is the sole runner for each: `bin/setup` (`SETUP_SCRIPT`, via
 * `runProjectSetup`) provisions whatever a feature build needs before it
 * starts, and `bin/teardown` (`TEARDOWN_SCRIPT`, via `runProjectTeardown`)
 * releases it immediately before the worktree is removed. Setup acquires,
 * teardown releases; keeping the pair here is what lets them share one
 * execution contract — the same executable resolution, the same
 * `sanitizeNamespace(basename(worktreePath))` namespace derivation, the same
 * `CI: 'true'` non-interactive environment, and the same output-tail helper —
 * rather than drifting apart in two modules.
 *
 * The module name says "prepare" while teardown is a removal-time concern.
 * That mismatch is a known, accepted cost of co-location, recorded as Option
 * A's con in `adr-2026-08-07-project-teardown-hook-contract-and-containment`
 * §3; this docblock is the mitigation the ADR requires in its place. Read the
 * name as "the project-script boundary", not "the pre-build step".
 *
 * Two divergences between the two runners are deliberate and easy to erase by
 * copying one onto the other (ADR §1, §2):
 *
 * - **The absent-script path is silent on the teardown side** and rides the
 *   `project_setup` event on the setup side. FR-4 promises a non-adopting
 *   project byte-identical log output, so teardown emits no line at all when
 *   `bin/teardown` is absent; the setup side reports `no-script` on the event
 *   spine and never writes a raw skip line
 *   (adr-2026-08-26-setup-once-per-worktree-marker decision 3).
 * - **Only teardown is time-bound**, via `execa`'s `timeout` (default 120s,
 *   overridable by `teardown_timeout_seconds`). There is deliberately no way
 *   to disable the bound — an unbounded project script sits in the daemon's
 *   critical path, which is the failure the ADR exists to prevent.
 *
 * `runProjectTeardown` is structurally contained (ADR §4): every failure mode
 * — non-zero exit, timeout, spawn error, missing execute permission — is
 * caught inside it and converted to a log entry. Its return type carries no
 * error and it never throws, so each of its three call sites invokes it as a
 * plain statement with no `try`/`catch` and still reaches removal on every
 * branch. Preserve that property when editing: moving a throw out of the
 * runner silently breaks all three callers at once.

 * Make a freshly-created feature worktree ready to build, before the conductor's

 *
 * Two responsibilities, both the *daemon's* (worktree creation is the daemon's
 * job, so the namespacing that flows from it is too):
 *
 *  1. **Write the namespace.** Set `WORKTREE_NAMESPACE=<worktree>` in the
 *     worktree's `.env` (idempotent). This is the single place per-worktree
 *     identity is established; the project's normal config consumes it (e.g.
 *     `database.yml` builds `app_<env>_<namespace>`), so concurrent worktrees
 *     never collide on one shared database.
 *  2. **Run the project's setup.** Execute the conventional `bin/setup` in the
 *     worktree with `CI=true` (so setup scripts skip interactive steps like
 *     starting a dev server) and `WORKTREE_NAMESPACE` exported. No `bin/setup`
 *     → no-op: the daemon stays infra-agnostic for projects that need nothing.
 *
 * Reusing the standard `bin/setup` (rather than a bespoke daemon-only script)
 * means the daemon runs exactly what a human / CI runs — `db:prepare` already
 * creates the namespaced database, dependencies install the same way, and there
 * is no second setup path to drift.
 *
 * Failure discipline: a non-zero exit from `bin/setup` throws. The caller
 * (`makeRunFeature`) catches it, keeps the worktree, and reports the feature as
 * errored — never building against a half-prepared environment.
 *
 * @param worktreePath Absolute path to the feature worktree.
 * @param log Optional progress sink (daemon log).
 * @param opts.verbose When true, echo `bin/setup`'s full output line-by-line
 *   into the log. Default (false) logs a one-line summary instead — a
 *   successful setup's output is dependency-manager chatter, and it dominated
 *   the daemon log (55% of lines) at no diagnostic value. Failures are
 *   unaffected: `SetupFailureError` still carries a 50-line output tail.
 * @param opts.dispatchStart Opt in to the per-dispatch lifecycle hook. This is
 *   restricted to daemon dispatch and setup-triage preparation by
 *   adr-2026-08-26 decision 7; resolve worktrees retain preparation without it.
 * @param opts.dispatchStartTimeoutSeconds Paired with `dispatchStart` and read
 *   only when it is true, so resolve worktrees cannot acquire hook behavior.
