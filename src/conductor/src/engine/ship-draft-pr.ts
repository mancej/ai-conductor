/**
 * SHIP-phase-entry draft PR publisher.
 *
 * The implementation PR used to be born at `finish`, at the very end of the
 * run. Opening it at SHIP entry lets the remaining ship steps work against the
 * same draft while the implementation branch stays out of release-artifact
 * maintenance.
 *
 * So the PR is now opened as a **draft** at the START of the SHIP phase and the
 * finish step flips it ready-for-review (`ensureShipReady`, already wired
 * through `repairFinishPr` in conductor.ts and verified by the ship-readiness
 * check in `artifacts.ts`). A draft PR cannot be merged and is excluded from
 * autoresolve/CI-fix remediation in `mergeable-sweep.ts`, so nothing downstream
 * acts on the feature until finish has flipped it.
 *
 * Design constraints (mirrors `pr-labels.ts`):
 *   - Injected `GhRunner` / `GitRunner` — no raw `execFile`, no real binary in
 *     tests.
 *   - **Advisory**: every failure logs one loud line and returns an outcome.
 *     Nothing here ever throws into the conductor loop; only the finish-time
 *     publish is load-bearing.
 *   - **Never bare-force-pushes.** The default is a plain
 *     `git push -u origin <branch>`; a non-fast-forward rejection is reported,
 *     not forced through. A caller that has itself rewritten the branch's
 *     history may opt into `pushMode: 'lease'`, which adds
 *     `--force-with-lease` — never a bare `--force`, so a genuinely-moved
 *     remote still fails closed. See {@link OpenShipDraftPrDeps.pushMode}.

/**
 * Compose the placeholder body for a SHIP-entry draft PR.
 *
 * The shape is the `/pr` skill's body template — `## Why` / `## What Changed` /
 * `## Testing`, plus the issue-linking reference — because that is exactly what
 * the finish completion gate demands before a PR may ship. The draft used to
 * emit a lone `## Summary`, which is not that template: a reader landing on the
 * PR mid-build, and the finish agent reading it back, both saw the WRONG
 * section shape, and the gate's refusal named a template neither had ever been
 * shown.
 *
 * It is still unmistakably a placeholder:
 *   - {@link PR_BODY_FLOOR_MARKER} keeps it mechanically detectable
 *     (`readFlooredBody`) so `finish` can never mistake it for authored prose;
 *   - each section carries a visible "not yet authored" line, so a human reader
 *     is never misled into thinking the prose is real.
 *
 * The `Closes` reference is named as an HTML comment rather than a live line:
 * `injectIssueRef` appends the REAL `Closes owner/repo#N` right after this body
 * is published (via `makeRetainedShipPrPresentable`), and a literal placeholder
 * `Closes` line would either render broken or defeat that helper's idempotency
 * probe.
 *
 * Deliberately carries NO release metadata: choosing a release disposition is
 * the pre-finish `release-disposition` step's job, judged from the real diff.
