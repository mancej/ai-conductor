// restart-marker.ts — the single source of truth for `.daemon/RESTART-PENDING`.
//
// Per adr-2026-07-04-pending-restart-queue: a `restart` requested against a busy
// daemon cannot interrupt in-flight work, so it queues durably instead — this
// marker is that queue. It carries a single logical intent (informational JSON:
// requestedAt/requestedBy/blockingSlug). Consume-once semantics: the marker is
// removed and its intent returned exactly once, at the next daemon boot — a
// fresh boot IS the restart, whether that boot fires the respawn itself or (in
// the bare-run case) is the replacement process. A crash before firing leaves
// the marker on disk to be consumed (and thus fulfilled) by the next boot; it
// can never fire twice or dangle.
