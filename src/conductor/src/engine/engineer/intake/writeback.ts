// engineer/intake/writeback.ts — shared intake write-back helpers.
//
// One implementation of the routed/done write-back used by deterministic CLI
// primitives (`engineer land` / `engineer handoff --source-ref`) and background
// intake processing. Keeping it in one place prevents the live paths from
// drifting in comments, labels, or ledger transitions.
//
// Both helpers are ADVISORY (FR-37): a gh outage or an absent ledger entry must
// never abort spec authoring or revert a delivered spec PR. They swallow ordinary
// errors, while a CorruptLedgerError reaches the CLI so it can fail closed rather
// than report success over unreadable durable state.
