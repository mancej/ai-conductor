// engineer/worktree-authoring.ts — per-idea worktree lifecycle for the engineer.
//
// The engineer authors and lands each idea's DECIDE set inside a DEDICATED worktree of
// the target repo (never the primary checkout), reusing the daemon's shared worktree
// mechanism (worktree-shared.ts) so the harness has ONE worktree story (PRD parity).
//
//   path convention: <canonicalPath>/.worktrees/engineer-<slug>   (disjoint from the
//                    daemon's <canonicalPath>/.worktrees/<slug>)
//   branch:          spec/<slug>                                   (the land/handoff branch)
//
// Lifecycle: the skill CREATES the worktree before DECIDE, authors + lands inside it, and
// on a SUCCESSFUL handoff REMOVES it; a failure leaves it for inspection (FR-5/FR-6).
//
// Strict abort (FR-7): if a worktree cannot be created — including a detached/unborn HEAD
// where the base branch cannot be derived — creation throws and makes ZERO mutation to the
// primary working tree. There is no fallback to authoring in the shared checkout.
