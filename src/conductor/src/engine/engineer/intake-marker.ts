//
// Called by live spec landing and daemon artifact maintenance. No-op for
// hand-authored specs (no sourceRef), so non-intake specs are unchanged.

/**
 * Write `.docs/intake/<slug>.md` with `Source-Ref: <sourceRef>` and, when an
 * `ownerIdentity` is supplied, an `Owner: <id>` line (FR-4 write side).
 *
 * FIELD-NAME COORDINATION (ADR-2 condition — adr-2026-06-30-owner-provenance-recording):
 * the owner is recorded on THIS marker rather than a competing artifact, so the
 * `Owner:` field name is shared with phase-9.3b (github-intake-writeback), which
 * also reads/writes this marker. The daemon's provenance reader
 * (`owner-gate/provenance.ts`) parses exactly `Owner:` — keep the two in lockstep.
 *
 * The owner is OMITTED entirely (never a blank `Owner:` line) when
 * `ownerIdentity` is null/absent/whitespace — a blank stamp is the "un-owned"
 * case (FR-12), not a false owner.
 *
 * No-op (returns null) only when there is NEITHER a valid `owner/repo#N`
 * sourceRef NOR an owner — so an owner is stamped even on a hand-authored,
 * non-intake spec (the marker then carries `Owner:` without `Source-Ref:`). The
 * path is guarded to stay inside `repoPath`. Returns the absolute marker path on
 * write.
 *
 * MERGE LOGIC (Slice B, Task 13):
 * When stamping an owner on the conduct path, pre-existing Source-Ref lines are
 * preserved: if the marker file exists and contains `Source-Ref:`, that line is
 * carried forward into the stamped marker. This handles the case where a spec was
 * routed from /engineer (intake origin tracked), then continued on the plain
 * /conduct path where the conduct owner stamping re-writes the marker to add Owner:.
