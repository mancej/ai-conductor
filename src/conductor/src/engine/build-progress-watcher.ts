 * the branch carries its `Task:` trailer.
 *
 * Why the union (#1086): since #773 deleted the evidence-ledger derivation
 * engine, nothing writes rows back during a build — the pipeline skill's
 * explicit `conduct task done` is the only writer, and an agent that commits
 * with a `Task:` trailer but never calls it leaves every row `pending` for the
 * whole build. Every *gating* consumer (the build completion predicate in
 * artifacts.ts, the conductor's stall breaker, the daemon's progress-re-kick
 * eligibility) already folds trailers in via `resolveTaskIds`; this watcher
 * counted raw rows only, so the operator-facing `build_progress` /
 * `build_no_progress` events reported a permanently pinned `resolved: 0`
 * ("▶ build 0/7") while the build was in fact committing task after task.
 *
 * Fail-soft: `resolveTaskIds` degrades to the row-only set on any git/fs
 * error, and a throw here falls back to the row count rather than aborting the

 *
 * Lifecycle: construct once per build-step attempt, `start()` immediately
 * before awaiting the step, `stop()` in a `finally` once the await settles.
 * `stop()` is idempotent and safe to call even if `start()` was never

 * keep the process alive on its own.
 *
 * Emission is change-driven (adr-2026-07-10-intra-step-build-progress-events,
 * Task 5): each tick diffs the freshly-read `TickSnapshot` (resolved, total,
 * currentTaskId, git HEAD, noEvidenceAttempts) against the last-emitted one
 * and only calls `events.emit` when something moved. A task-count delta, a
 * new commit landing on HEAD with no task delta, a current-task change, or a
 * bare noEvidenceAttempts bump all count as "changed". A HEAD change also
 * populates `commitCount` via `git rev-list --count <old>..<new>` (best
 * effort — omitted if that probe fails). An unchanged tick emits nothing
 * (beyond the heartbeat/quiet-episode checks described below).
 *
 * Quiet-episode tracking (Task 7): the watcher also maintains a
 * `build_no_progress` episode state machine — `lastChangeAt` (the timestamp
 * of the most recent change-driven tick) and `quietFired` (whether this
 * episode has already emitted). Once the time since `lastChangeAt` crosses
 * `quiet_minutes`, `build_no_progress` fires exactly once (guarded by
 * `quietFired`); continued quiet emits nothing further. Any subsequent
 * change-driven tick re-arms the episode (`quietFired` reset to false,
 * `lastChangeAt` bumped to now), so a later quiet stretch fires again.
