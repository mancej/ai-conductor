 *
 * Per gate surface kind (see `GATE_SURFACE`):
 * - 'feature-runtime' (architecture_review_as_built): preserved iff

 * - 'feature-codetest' (build_review): preserved iff `featureSrc` AND the
 *   feature's own test paths are both empty — a foreign-only delta (runtime
 *   or test) cannot change the feature's own diff, so its plan-vs-diff grade
 *   survives the rebase.
 * - 'all-runtime' (manual_test): preserved iff both

 * - 'any-codetest' (test_suite): preserved iff `D` is entirely empty
 *   (test ∪ featureSrc ∪ foreignSrc all empty). Aggregate verification
