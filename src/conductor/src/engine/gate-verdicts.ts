 * exists to distrust. A verdict-bearing step skipped for a tier or in auto
 * mode could therefore ship "done" with no `.pipeline/gates/<step>.json`
 * anywhere in the audit record.
 *
 * The verdict is `satisfied: true` because that is what the selector already
 * does with a skipped gate (`isSkipped` short-circuits ahead of
