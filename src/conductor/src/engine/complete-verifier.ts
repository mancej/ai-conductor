 * walked all 14 steps without an early return — but cascading lax gates
 * meant the marker could land without the SHIP phase having genuinely run.
 *
 * This helper detects that case: any worktree whose state claims complete
 * but where test_suite / manual_test / finish predicates can't reproduce
 * `done: true` is "stale-complete" and should be rolled back.
 *
 * `sessionStartedAt` is intentionally NOT passed in; we use the worktree
 * state's persisted value (or undefined → predicates fail open). That way
 * a feature that legitimately completed in a previous session still verifies
 * — only the ones missing the underlying artifacts come back as gaps.
