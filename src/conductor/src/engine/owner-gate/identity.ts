// owner-gate/identity.ts — resolve "who is this daemon building for?"
//
// The daemon must answer WHO it builds for before it can gate merged specs by
// owner (ADR: adr-2026-06-30-owner-gate-identity-resolution). Resolution is an
// ordered chain behind a seam: a CONFIGURED owner wins; else the gh-authed
// login; else UNRESOLVED (the gate is inactive / fail-open, handled by callers).
//
// Naming boundary (ADR-1): the operator concept is `specOwner` / `daemonOwner` /
// `ownerIdentity` — NEVER a bare `owner` identifier, which is reserved for
// `daemon-lock.ts`'s lock-holding process. This module is the operator feature;
// the lock is untouched.
//
// Forward-compat seam: `resolveDaemonOwner` composes injectable steps, so a
// future `PlatformIdentity` (EKS/OIDC) resolver can replace the chain without
// changing the gate's build/skip behavior.
