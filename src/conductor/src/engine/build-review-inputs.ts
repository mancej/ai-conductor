/**
 * Assemble the build_review grader's inputs: the diff since the merge-base

 * strictly `(git, planPath)` — no conductor state.
 *
 * Base resolution goes through `resolveFreshBase` (Task 2): when the local
 * tracking ref is stale relative to the true remote head, it fetches before
 * computing the merge-base, so build_review never grades a diff against a
 * stale origin snapshot. On no-remote/probe-failure, it falls back to the
 * pre-existing local-branch behavior — degraded, but still functional — and
 * emits one advisory log so operators can see why the base wasn't fresh.
