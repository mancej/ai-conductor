/**
 * Volatile paths the harness WRITES ITSELF while a self-hosted build runs.
 * Fingerprinting them made the guard fail on its own bookkeeping (#985) — the
 * canary halted at the exact millisecond the daemon appended to `.daemon/`:
 *   `.git`       — the shared git dir; commits/fetches made from inside the
 *                  sandboxed worktree rewrite objects/refs/logs/index here.
 *   `.daemon`    — daemon runtime state; `daemon.log` is appended continuously.
 *   `.worktrees` — the per-feature checkouts the build is SUPPOSED to mutate;
 *                  they only fall inside this surface because the live checkout
 *                  and the project root are the same directory.
 *   `.pipeline`  — per-run pipeline state (task-status, evidence sidecar, gate
 *                  verdicts, `.memory-count-at-start`). The daemon writes into
 *                  the LIVE checkout's own `.pipeline/` while a self-host build
 *                  is in flight, so fingerprinting it halts the run on the
 *                  harness's own bookkeeping.
 *   `.claude/worktrees`
 *                — the throwaway checkouts agents isolate into. They live under
 *                  the live checkout but are NOT reached by `.worktrees` above,
 *                  so isolating an agent tripped the guard mid-run. Scoped to
 *                  this SUBTREE deliberately: `.claude/settings.json` and
 *                  `.claude/hooks/` are harness state the guard must protect,
 *                  and excluding all of `.claude` would blind it to them.
 *   `src/conductor/dist-versions`
 *                — generated versioned distribution snapshots. Scoped to this
 *                  exact subtree so same-named source directories elsewhere
 *                  remain fingerprinted.
 *   `node_modules` — dependency and tool-cache trees at any nesting depth. The
 *                    exact directory basename is excluded; lookalikes remain
 *                    fingerprinted, and `.gitignore` is deliberately not used.
 * None of these is harness SOURCE, so everything the guard exists to protect
 * stays fingerprinted. After a mismatch, tracked Git modifications/deletions
 * (`M`/`D`) on this surface are treated as operator edits and do not halt;
 * untracked paths and indeterminate/failed Git classification still halt
 * fail-closed. Git cannot identify the writer, so an escaped process rewriting
 * already-tracked content is indistinguishable from an operator edit and is
 * the accepted residual gap in this guard.

/**
 * Noise the CURRENT provider's home accumulates from parties OTHER than the
 * sandboxed build: an unrelated interactive session sharing the machine, or a
 * background job the provider CLI runs on its own schedule. Unlike
 * `LIVE_CHECKOUT_VOLATILE` above, this surface is a LEAK DETECTOR — the
 * sandboxed build gets a throwaway provider home, so the LIVE home should
 * never change at all. Excluding a path here therefore trades away real
 * detection power, not just harness self-bookkeeping; see
 * `.docs/architecture/sequences/provider-neutral-self-host-isolation-907.md`.
 *
 * Every entry below is usage/log/cache telemetry that a genuine leak would
 * not plausibly announce itself through on its own — it is written by any
 * concurrent Claude process regardless of whether a self-host build is
 * running. Verified for #907: 18 files under a live `~/.claude` changed in a
 * 12-minute window during a real self-host run, written by an unrelated
 * interactive session and background jobs, not the sandboxed build:
 * `settings.json`, `history.jsonl`, `.last-cleanup`,
 * `plugins/known_marketplaces.json`, `shell-snapshots/*`, `backups/*`,
 * `sessions/*`. The remaining entries are the same category of noise,
 * confirmed by read-only inspection of a live `~/.claude` (file purpose +
 * observed churn), not by a second incident.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT excluded, despite being verified noise in that same
 * incident: `settings.json`. It is genuinely ambiguous — most of the time an
 * unrelated interactive session changing a permission or hook setting, but a
 * self-host process reaching back and rewriting operator config/hooks is
 * exactly what this surface exists to catch. There is no clean way to tell
 * those apart from a diff alone. Excluding it would blind the guard to a
 * real leak into the most sensitive file this surface protects; keeping it
 * fingerprinted means an interactive settings change can trip a concurrent
 * build. This implementation keeps detection: `settings.json`,
 * `settings.local.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `rules/`, `skills/`, and any other
 * config-like path not listed below stay fingerprinted.
 *
 * `file-history` added after five halts on 2026-07-28 (build_review,
 * maintain-documentation and three `architecture_review_as_built` steps, all
 * dispatched `via claude`). Every halt window contained fresh
 * `file-history/<session-uuid>/<hash>@vN` entries written by UNRELATED
 * interactive sessions — the CLI snapshots every file it edits there, so any
 * concurrent session editing a file tripped the guard. The sandboxed build
 * writes its own snapshots under its throwaway `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so
 * excluding this costs no leak detection: the subtree holds edited-file
 * content only, never config, hooks, or credentials. `paste-cache` is the
 * same category (per-session scratch for large pasted inputs).
 *
 * `downloads`, `settings.json.bak` and `ai-conductor.config.json` were left
 * fingerprinted: no churn was observed for them, and the latter two are
 * config-like — a self-host process rewriting harness config in the operator
 * home is exactly what this surface exists to catch.
