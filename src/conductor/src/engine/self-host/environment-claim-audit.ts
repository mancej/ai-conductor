// self-host/environment-claim-audit.ts — deterministic refutation of claimed
// environmental blockers (#1106).
//
// A self-build dispatch once halted with:
//
//   "**Blocker:** The environment's write-fence sandbox blocks both `git push`
//    and `gh pr` operations. ... Neither path is executable in this sandbox
//    environment."
//
// That blocker could not exist. The step ran under the `claude` provider, which
// is dispatched with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, no OS sandbox, and full
// environment inheritance; and the only environmental control installed for it
// is the write fence, whose generated script denies nothing but writes under the
// live harness checkout outside the build worktree. The fabricated blocker
// arrived formatted exactly like the four genuinely-verified gate results above
// it, so nothing distinguished invention from diagnosis — and completed, tested
// work never shipped.
//
// Per the repo Design Principle (CLAUDE.md): deterministic where possible. The
// engine knows, at dispatch time, the facts the agent was guessing at — which
// provider ran, and what the provisioned write fence can actually deny. So a
// claimed environmental blocker naming an operation the engine can prove is
// unfenced is REJECTED at the moment it is written, and the dispatch fails with
// the refutation as its retry reason, instead of being trusted as prose.
//
// The audit is deliberately asymmetric: it only ever refutes a claim the engine
// can positively disprove. Anything it cannot disprove (unknown provider, a
// sandboxed provider, a fence that really does match the named operation) is
// left entirely alone.
