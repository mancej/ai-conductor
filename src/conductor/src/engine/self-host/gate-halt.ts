// self-host/gate-halt.ts — shared HALT plumbing for the self-host finish gates.
//
// The version + release-artifact gates run in the daemon's `auto` mode where
// there is no human to prompt (adr-2026-06-30-halt-based-release-gates). A gate
// that cannot self-satisfy writes `.pipeline/HALT` and the finish flow stops
// BEFORE opening a PR — the feature parks until the operator resumes. Each gate
// supplies its own distinct first-line reason (the daemon dashboard surfaces the
// first non-empty line), so the operator sees exactly which gate parked the
// build. ADR-005/ADR-010 invariant: the daemon never merges — every self-build
// ends at a HALT for the operator to address the reason, clear both HALT markers,
// let the daemon re-run the gates and update the PR, then merge it themselves.
