// self-host/wiring.ts — the injectable bundle the daemon loop activates for a
// harness self-build (Phase 6).
//
// The six guardrail PRIMITIVES already exist and are unit-tested in isolation.
// This module is the single seam the Conductor calls them through, so the live
// wiring is:
//   - activated as ONE unit behind a single `isSelfHost` decision, and
//   - hermetically testable — the conductor integration tests inject a spy
//     bundle instead of running the real relink / sandbox / gates.
// It adds NO new behavior; every member forwards to an existing primitive.
