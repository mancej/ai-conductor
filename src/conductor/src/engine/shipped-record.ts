 * This digest is the canonical "content fingerprint" used to decide whether a
 * spec's implementation has already shipped, so the daemon never re-dispatches
 * or re-kicks work whose plan (and stories, if present) are unchanged. It is
 * persisted alongside shipped-work records and compared byte-for-byte on
 * future dispatch decisions — changing this function's output for
 * already-hashed content is a breaking change to that persisted identity.
 *
 * Canonicalization rules (deliberately narrow, do not expand without updating
 * this comment and the shipped-record persistence format):
 *   - Only a trailing run of newline bytes is trimmed from each buffer before
 *     hashing. This makes "content" and "content\n" hash identically, since
 *     editors/tools frequently add or remove a single trailing newline
 *     without any semantic change to the spec.
 *   - Interior bytes are never modified. Any change inside the content,
 *     including whitespace, changes the digest.
 *   - CRLF ("\r\n") line endings are NOT normalized to LF ("\n"). This is
 *     pinned, intentional behavior: line-ending normalization is a distinct
 *     concern from trailing-newline trimming, and silently coercing CRLF to
 *     LF could mask real content differences across platforms.
 *
 * When storiesBytes is null/undefined, only the plan bytes are hashed and
 * storiesIncluded is reported as false so callers can distinguish "no
 * stories yet" from "stories present but empty."
