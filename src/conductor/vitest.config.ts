// constructs anything. `os.tmpdir()` reads TMPDIR at call time, so every
// `mkdtemp(join(tmpdir(), …))` in the suite — the ~1,426 call sites, most of
// which never clean up — lands inside that root, and test/global-setup.ts
// deletes it wholesale at teardown. Installed here rather than in globalSetup
// because vitest's project tmpDir is computed before globalSetup (see
// ensureRunTmpRootSync). Package scripts install the redirect before Vitest 4
// itself loads; this idempotent call covers programmatic project creation.
// Forked workers inherit the env, proven by tmpdir-redirect-propagation.test.ts.
