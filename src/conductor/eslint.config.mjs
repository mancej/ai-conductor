// Type-aware ESLint for the conductor engine.
//
// Deliberately NOT a stock preset. `strict: true` in tsconfig.json already covers
// the stylistic and basic-correctness ground a preset would add, so a preset here
// is pure noise across ~85k lines. The rules below are limited to the class of bug
// `tsc` structurally cannot find: promises that are created and then dropped.
//
// This is an async daemon built on execa/chokidar. A dropped promise does not throw
// — it presents as a silent stall, which is this repository's dominant failure mode.
//
// POLICY: errors only, never warnings. Every rule below is `error`; a rule too noisy
// to run at `error` is turned off outright and recorded here with the reason. There
// is no advisory tier — a warning nobody reads only teaches people to ignore the
// tool. `npm run lint` additionally passes `--max-warnings=0`.
