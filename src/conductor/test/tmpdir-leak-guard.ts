/**
 * Temp-directory leak containment for the vitest suite (two mechanisms).
 *
 * THE BUG: 1,426 `mkdtemp(join(tmpdir(), '<prefix>-'))` calls across ~398 test
 * files, and only a fraction ever remove what they created. Each full run left
 * thousands of directories behind in the operator's real `/tmp`. On a tmpfs
 * `/tmp` that eventually exhausted inodes and space, which broke unrelated
 * production processes with `ENOSPC` — the leak escaped the test suite.
 *
 * MECHANISM 1 — redirect (`createRunTmpRoot` + `TMPDIR`): one run-scoped root
 * is created inside the REAL tmpdir and `process.env.TMPDIR` is pointed at it.
 * Node's `os.tmpdir()` reads `TMPDIR` on every call, so every existing and
 * every future `mkdtemp(join(tmpdir(), ...))` lands inside the run root with
 * zero test-file edits. Teardown removes the root wholesale, so a test that
 * forgets to clean up costs one run's disk, not the machine's.
 *
 * MECHANISM 2 — guard (`snapshotTmpdirEntries` + `diffTmpdirEntries`): the
 * redirect only contains calls that go through `os.tmpdir()`. A test that
 * hardcodes `/tmp`, caches `os.tmpdir()` before the redirect, or spawns a
 * process with a scrubbed env still escapes. So snapshot the REAL tmpdir's
 * top-level entries at setup, diff at teardown, and FAIL the run on any new
 * entry that is not the run root and not known concurrent-tooling noise. This
 * is the same snapshot/diff/fail shape already used by the `.pipeline`,
 * tmux, and engineer-signals guards.
