// Tmux daemon-session leak guard (#377) — suite-level net for the leak class
// no in-process kill-switch can catch: a child process spawned without
// AI_CONDUCTOR_NO_REAL_EXEC in its env, or a test injecting a real runner,
// can create a real `cc-daemon-*` tmux session hosting a full
// `conduct-ts daemon --continuous` that outlives its deleted /tmp fixture
// repo. The global teardown diffs the session list against the suite-start
// snapshot, kills every leaked session (so nothing stays resident), and then
// FAILS the run naming each session and its pane cwd — the cwd's fixture
// prefix (e.g. `loop-test-`, `intake-life-`) attributes the leak to a file.
//
// Sessions that existed BEFORE the suite (the operator's real repo daemon,
// e.g. `cc-daemon-james-stoup-agents-*`) are never touched.
//
// TWO-SIGNAL FAIL-CLOSED CONTRACT (#437, TR-1/TR-2/TR-3):
// A session is only ever killed when BOTH corroborating signals are present:
//   1. Baseline snapshot succeeded (`snapshot.failed === false`) — a failed
//      baseline means "not in before" can't be trusted as "new", so it must
//      never be used to authorize a kill.
//   2. The session's pane cwd resolves AND is tmpdir-rooted
//      (`isTmpdirRooted(cwd)` — see below). A pane cwd outside os.tmpdir()
//      (e.g. the operator's real repo) is never a leak candidate.
// Missing EITHER signal degrades to report-only: the session is left running
// and named in the `indeterminate` bucket, never killed. A failed baseline
// snapshot disables reaping entirely for that run — every live session is
// reported as indeterminate rather than killed, so a transient snapshot
// failure can never take down a production daemon session. Report messages
// use fixed, greppable, mutually non-overlapping prefixes so a killed leak
// and an indeterminate (fail-closed, left running) report are never
// confusable in logs: `tmux-leak-guard: KILLED leaked session…` vs
// `tmux-leak-guard: NOT killed (fail-closed): …`.
//
// PERMANENT-BASELINE-BLINDSPOT FIX (2026-07-12, ~400-session incident):
// `reapLeakedDaemonSessions` only ever inspects sessions ABSENT from the
// suite-start baseline (`before.has(name) ⇒ skip, no inspection at all`).
// That is correct for distinguishing "new this run" from "the operator's
// long-lived daemon" WHEN the run's own teardown gets to execute — but
// vitest's `globalTeardown` is a normal-exit-only hook: it never fires on
// SIGKILL, an external `timeout`-style SIGTERM, or a crashed/OOM-killed
// worker. When a run is interrupted before teardown runs, any session it
// leaked survives into the NEXT run's baseline snapshot — at which point
// `before.has(name)` is true FOREVER, and the diff-based reaper never even
// looks at its pane cwd again. Repeat across enough interrupted runs (this
// harness is driven by many short-lived agent invocations against a 2-minute
// default Bash timeout) and leaked sessions accumulate without bound — this
// is exactly how ~400 stale `cc-daemon-*` sessions piled up in production.
//
// `sweepStaleDaemonSessions` (below) closes the hole with an orthogonal,
// unconditional check that runs BEFORE the baseline is taken: any
// `cc-daemon-*` session whose pane cwd is tmpdir-rooted is, by construction,
// never the operator's real per-repo daemon (a real daemon's cwd is always a
// real repo checkout, never `os.tmpdir()`) — so tmpdir-rootedness alone is
// sufficient kill authority here, with no "new this run" requirement, because
// at sweep time EVERYTHING found necessarily predates this run. This makes
// the guard self-healing: even a session that leaked past every prior run's
// teardown gets swept the next time ANY vitest invocation starts.
