/**
 * Acceptance specs for .docs/stories/canonical-tracker-client-seam-with-per-backend-tra.md
 * (TR-1 negative path): the kill-switch (`assertRealExecAllowed`, reached through the
 * canonical `makeProductionGh`) must engage BEFORE spawning a process at every
 * production call site — including the two bypass holes the story names explicitly:
 * "paths reached from the engineer CLI and halt-issues CLI composition roots".
 *
 * Per /writing-system-tests §3d, a unit test of `assertRealExecAllowed`/the canonical
 * `makeProductionGh` in isolation (test/tracker-client.test.ts, written during /tdd)
 * proves the guard works — it does NOT prove the guard is wired into these two real
 * production call sites. Today it is not:
 *   - engineer-cli.ts's local `makeProductionGh` (used by `dispatchEngineer`'s
 *     poll/claim/... paths) calls `execFileP('gh', ...)` directly, no guard.
 *   - halt-issues-cli.ts's local `makeProductionGh` (used by `dispatchHaltIssuesSweep`)
 *     calls `execa('gh', ...)` directly, no guard.
 * This file drives the REAL composition roots (`dispatchEngineer`,
 * `dispatchHaltIssuesSweep`) with no fake runner injected — exactly like a live CLI
 * invocation — under the suite's global `AI_CONDUCTOR_NO_REAL_EXEC=1` (test/setup.ts),
 * and asserts the observable guarantee: no real child process is ever spawned. It fails
 * today for the WRONG reason (the process spy observes a real `gh` invocation attempt)
 * until the migration (plan Tasks 1, 10, 13) routes both composition roots through the
 * canonical guarded factory.
 *
 * Argv-parity, per-operation unit behavior, and halt-issues call-count parity are
 * unit-level and already covered by test/tracker-client.test.ts (written during
 * /pipeline) and the existing test/engine/halt-issues/sweep.test.ts (call-count
 * invariants asserted directly against `sweep()` with an injected fake) — this file
 * only covers the cross-module "does the real CLI entry point actually reach the
 * guard" gap, which no existing test exercises (existing halt-issues-cli.test.ts only
 * drives the 'help'/'guide' kinds of `dispatchHaltIssuesSweep`, never 'sweep').
