/**
 * Acceptance specs for .docs/stories/build-auth-token-check-and-classify.md
 * (FR-4), governed by .docs/specs/2026-07-22-build-auth-token-check-and-classify.md
 * and .docs/plans/2026-07-22-build-auth-token-check-and-classify.md (Task 4).
 *
 * WHY ACCEPTANCE-LEVEL (not unit): FR-4 requires that a rejected-credential
 * build failure parks (park-and-poll on the daemon build-token source, zero
 * retry/escalation budget burned) on the CONCURRENT group dispatch path, not
 * just the serial path. `runGroupBranch` (group-core.ts) already surfaces an
 * `authFailure` result as a `no-verdict` outcome (see the comment at
 * group-core.ts ~488-494: "this task does not implement park/resume itself —
 * that belongs to the group CORE/join logic"). Today, the JOIN logic in
 * `Conductor.run()` (conductor.ts, the `noVerdictIdx !== -1` branch, ~2237)
 * treats EVERY no-verdict reason identically: it writes a loud
 * `.pipeline/HALT` ("... produced no-verdict after exhausting its retries
 * (authFailure).") and returns immediately — the exact per-feature-cascade
 * failure mode #484/#483 this feature closes, just one layer up (group
 * instead of serial). A unit test that calls `runGroupBranch` directly and
 * asserts it returns `{kind:'no-verdict', reason:'authFailure'}` (already
 * true today) would prove NOTHING about whether `Conductor.run()`'s join
 * still treats that outcome as a generic exhausted-retries HALT — the bug
 * lives in the JOIN, not the branch. This file drives the real
 * `Conductor.run()` entry point (same convention as
 * `parallel-validation-phase-fan-out-manual-test-prd-.acceptance.test.ts`
 * and `isolate-daemon-build-auth-from-operator-oauth.acceptance.test.ts`)
 * against the real built-in SHIP-tail validation group (manual_test,
 * prd_audit, architecture_review_as_built — group-core.ts / steps.ts, width
 * 3) so a fan-out actually engages, with a fake `StepRunner` that returns the
 * observed 401 shape from `manual_test`.
 *
 * Per-call-site unit behavior (classifier pattern matching, precedence,
 * bare-401 non-match) is unit-level and belongs to
 * test/execution/claude-provider.test.ts (plan Tasks 1-3) — not duplicated
 * here. The serial dispatch path already has a working authFailure
 * park-and-poll branch (conductor.ts ~3082, proven by
 * sandbox-auth-expiry-park.acceptance.test.ts /
 * isolate-daemon-build-auth-from-operator-oauth.acceptance.test.ts); plan
 * Task 5 pins that the NEW classifier patterns reach it, at the unit/
 * engine-test layer (verify-only) — not duplicated here either. This file
 * covers ONLY the group/join path, which is genuinely new production
 * behavior with a real risk of shipping as an orphaned branch-level flag
 * (green `runGroupBranch` unit test, join never consults it — the #297/#733
 * "new primitive, inert feature" failure class this repo's own
 * writing-system-tests skill (§3b) exists to catch).
 *
 * PRE-FIX RED: as of this file's authoring, the join's `noVerdictIdx !== -1`
 * branch does not special-case `reason === 'authFailure'` — it always writes
 * `.pipeline/HALT` with a message containing "no-verdict after exhausting
 * its retries" and returns, regardless of reason. Every scenario below fails
 * for that reason until plan Task 4 lands.
 *
 * ASSUMPTION FLAGGED (per verify-claims / writing-system-tests correctness
 * gate): neither the story, the PRD, nor the plan pins the EXACT mechanism
 * the join uses to retry the group after park resolves (e.g. `continue`-ing
 * the outer per-step loop to re-dispatch the whole group fresh, vs. some
 * other resumption shape). This file therefore asserts only the OBSERVABLE
 * contract the story text pins: (a) no generic "exhausted its retries" HALT
 * while a park is live, (b) the operator-facing failure is reported as an
 * auth/credential park (not a bare no-verdict/HALT), (c) zero dispatch
 * attempts of `manual_test` beyond the one that hit the rejected credential
 * plus the one that succeeds after the token refreshes (i.e. no retry-ladder
 * spin), and (d) the group step reaches `done` automatically once the token
 * file is refreshed, with no operator action. It does NOT assert internal
 * loop-index/state-key mechanics. Confidence the join needs a genuinely new
 * branch here (not already-passing behavior): ~95% (verified by reading
 * conductor.ts's noVerdictIdx branch directly, quoted above).
