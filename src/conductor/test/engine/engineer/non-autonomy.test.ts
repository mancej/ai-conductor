// non-autonomy.test.ts — Structural non-autonomy guarantee (Task 30, FR-10, ADR-005 Condition 2)
//
// This test suite asserts the hardest structural invariant for the engineer:
//   1. The engineer's transitive import graph does NOT include the pipeline/build
//      entry (conductor.ts, step-runners.ts, daemon-runner.ts) NOR any source
//      that issues a `gh pr merge` or merge-API call.
//   2. Any daemon the engineer can launch is FULLY DETACHED FROM THE ENGINEER:
//      it delegates to a start-only seam (ADR-014: tmux new-session -d) and
//      retains no handle, no IPC, no stop/restart — launch ≠ manage (ADR-005 FR-8,
//      mechanism updated by ADR-014).
//
// FORBIDDEN-TOKEN RATIONALE
// ─────────────────────────
// The engineer is allowed to call `gh pr create` (via an injected runner in
// handoff.ts) because that opens a spec PR. It is NOT allowed to call
// `gh pr merge`, use the GitHub merge API, or import the pipeline engine that
// runs builds. The forbidden-token check therefore targets:
//   • The literal string 'pr merge' (catches `gh pr merge`)
//   • The string 'merge' ONLY when it appears in a context that looks like a
//     gh command call: adjacent to 'gh' on the same line (covers shell strings
//     and argument arrays).
//   • The string 'conductor.ts' / '../conductor' / './conductor' as an import
//     (catches any future accidental import of the build-pipeline entry).
//   • The strings 'step-runners' and 'daemon-runner' as imports (these are
//     pipeline internals the engineer must never touch).
//
// Strings that are INTENTIONALLY present in engineer sources and must NOT
// trigger false-positives:
//   • `'pr', 'create'` in handoff.ts — PR creation is allowed
//   • The word 'merge' in English prose / comments that don't accompany 'gh'
//   • Any reference to `daemon.ts` via a TYPE-ONLY import in engineer-store.ts
//     (FeatureOutcome type). That is acceptable because a type import carries
//     no executable dependency.
//
// HOW THE IMPORT WALK WORKS
// ──────────────────────────
// Engineer entry roots:
//   - src/engine/engineer-cli.ts (dispatchEngineer — CLI dispatcher)
//   - Every TypeScript module under src/engine/engineer/.
//
// The walk:
//   1. Starts from each engineer entry root.
//   2. Parses `from './path.js'` / `from '../path.js'` specifiers (NodeNext
//      ESM style — .js extension on disk maps to .ts).
//   3. Resolves each specifier to an absolute .ts path.
//   4. Recurses, ignoring bare (node_modules) specifiers.
//   5. Keeps a visited set to avoid cycles.
//
// The resulting reachable set is all local source files the engineer pulls in
// transitively. This is then grepped for forbidden tokens.

//   B. Inline `git checkout -- <path>` on harness paths — force-overwrites
//      tracked files outside the spec branch commit; forbidden.
//      We detect the form `checkout -- ` which always means "restore a file
//      to its committed/index state" (destructive to working-tree files).
//   C. A pipeline entry call (`conduct`, `pipeline`, `step-runners`) triggered
//      for a self-edit target — any call that starts a build rather than just
//      proposing a spec PR; covered by the existing FORBIDDEN_MODULE_SUFFIXES
