/**
 * Real-binary smoke test for Story 4 / Task 13 (RED phase):
 * "A recording-only completion miss triggers a surgical retry, not a full
 * re-walk" (.docs/stories/finish-step-completion-becomes-engine-machinery-re.md,
 * ADR D4).
 *
 * Pattern: test/smoke/finish-record.smoke.test.ts (nested-mkdtemp isolated
 * repo, real `bin/conduct-ts` child process, no fakes for the final leg).
 *
 * Scenario: an isolated repo whose finish attempt has every completion
 * condition satisfiable EXCEPT the `.pipeline/finish-choice` recording marker
 * itself is absent (a pure recording-only gap — Task 1's own example case).
 *
 *   1. The REAL engine entry point `checkStepCompletion` (src/engine/artifacts.ts)
 *      must classify this as `missing: 'recording'` — a facet code that does
 *      not exist on `CompletionResult` yet (Task 1).
 *   2. The REAL retry-dispatch entry point `buildRetryHint` (src/engine/conductor.ts)
 *      must, on a recording-only miss, surface the narrow `conduct-ts
 *      finish-record` command with the absolute `--pipeline-dir` instead of
 *      the generic "finish the work now" fallback — a branch that does not
 *      exist yet (Task 11).
 *   3. Running that named command against the REAL binary and re-evaluating
 *      completion proves the one-command completion once wired.
 *
 * Expected to fail for the RIGHT reason right now: `completion.missing` is
 * `undefined` (not `'recording'`), and the retry hint contains none of the
 * `finish-record` command text — not a syntax error, not a trivially-true
 * assertion.
